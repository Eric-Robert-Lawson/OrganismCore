**The contents of this directory are important, but can also go into 00_culmination point folder to continue forward upon the foundation we already built.** 

**But remember to onboard the order correctly.**

AGENTS (articles folder) -> subdomain_agents (subdomain_articles folder except readme file) -> qualia axioms folder (everything but hodge conjecture toolkit and potential hodge conjecture counterexample)

Then from there we take the remaining two files from the axiom folder (not including two images) and round up the reasoning artifacts in validator_v2 folder and the tex files from both validator and validator_v2 folder to continue onboarding.

Then from there we can continue onboarding with the "00_culmination point" folder ordering. The first is the foundation build on 01-26-2026 (january 27th 2026).
