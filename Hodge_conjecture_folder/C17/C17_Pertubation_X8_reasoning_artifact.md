# **The analysis**

examining The variety X₈ ⊂ ℙ^5 defined by:

```verbatim
X₈: Σ_{i=0}^5 z_i^8 + δ·Σ_{k=1}^{16} (Σ_{j=0}^5 ω^{kj}z_j)^8 = 0

where ω = e^{2πi/17}, δ = 791/100000
```

The first 19 primes mod 17=1 are:

```verbatim
103, 137, 239, 307, 409, 443, 613, 647, 919, 953, 1021, 1123, 1259, 1327, 361, 1429, 1531, 1667, 1871
```

# **Step 1: Smoothness Test**
this is easy for typical C17 cyclotomic and is not computationally heavy, however for X8 pertubation, the GB blows up the memory far beyond my machines 16gb capacity so we resorted to:

```m2
TBD
```
