# **RECOMPUTING RESULTS FROM SCRATCH TO CONFIRM RESULTS!**

Perhaps this reasoning artifact can preserve the full logic more clean. I will be manually logging and preserving the calculations.

WE WILL BE RECOMPUTING EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH, IT IS SUSPECTED THAT ORIGINAL REASONING ARTIFACTS AND SOME RESULTS ARE PREDICATED OFF OF FAULTY RECOLLECTIONS OF DATA. SO FULL REPRODUCIBILITY IS VALUED ABOVE ALL ELSE. THIS REASONING ARTIFACT WILL REPRODUCE FROM SCRATCH WITH SCRIPTS THAT WILL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS FROM STEP 1 TO END.

Will require the files in validator_v2/invariant_jsons to reproduce from scratch. This is important!

# **The claim**

examining The variety X₈ ⊂ ℙ^5 defined by:

```verbatim
X₈: Σ_{i=0}^5 z_i^8 + δ·Σ_{k=1}^{12} (Σ_{j=0}^5 ω^{kj}z_j)^8 = 0

where ω = e^{2πi/13}, δ = 791/100000
```

# **STEP 1: SMOOTHNESS TEST**

this is easy for typical C13 cyclotomic and is not computationally heavy, however for X8 pertubation, the GB blows up the memory far beyond my machines 16gb capacity so we resorted to:

Instead I compute the following fairly quickly:

The reason for such a high tests per prime is to ensure smoothness count and no singularity findings. Also number of primes helps show it is not a fluke:
