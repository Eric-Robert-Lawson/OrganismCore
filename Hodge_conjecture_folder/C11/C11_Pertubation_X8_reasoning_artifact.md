# **The analysis**

examining The variety X₈ ⊂ ℙ^5 defined by:

```verbatim
X₈: Σ_{i=0}^5 z_i^8 + δ·Σ_{k=1}^{10} (Σ_{j=0}^5 ω^{kj}z_j)^8 = 0

where ω = e^{2πi/11}, δ = 791/100000
```

the first 19 primes mod 11=1 are:

```verbatim
23, 67, 89, 199, 331, 353, 397, 419, 463, 617, 661, 683, 727, 859, 881, 947, 991, 1013, 1123
```

# **Step 1: Smoothness Test**
this is easy for typical C11 cyclotomic and is not computationally heavy, however for X8 pertubation, the GB blows up the memory far beyond my machines 16gb capacity so we resorted to:

```m2
TBD
```
