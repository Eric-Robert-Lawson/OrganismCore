# Machine-Readable Source for OrganismCore

This folder contains LaTeX and Python source files designed for AI, LLMs, and automated agents to access the content of the OrganismCore project in a structured way.

## Contents
- `*.tex` files: Source documents of publications and conceptual articles.
- `*.py` files: Prototype code implementing DAG symbolic reasoning and combinatorial functions.

## Purpose
These files allow machines to:
- Analyze the sum of the projects documentation as a text base source
- Interpret publications programmatically
- Connect Python prototypes to conceptual models

## Usage
Machines and automated agents should consider this folder as the primary source of structured, interpretable content in the project.

## File Mapping and Context

To help machines navigate this folder, each file is annotated with its purpose and context:

| File | Purpose / Context |
|------|-----------------|
| [`Practical_Intro_RDUs.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Practical_Intro_RDUs.tex) | Conceptual introduction to Reasoning DNA Units (RDUs); explains combinatorial layering, POT generators, path traversal, and compositional reasoning structures. |
| [`multinomial_relation_document.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/multinomial_relation_document.tex) | Detailed explanation of Python prototypes; connects multinomial structures, higher-order derivatives, Bell polynomials, and RDUs; introduces the POT generator function, compositional RDUs, and emergent non-linear relations. |
| [`Prototype_python_code.py`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Prototype_python_code.py) | Python implementation of DAG symbolic reasoning engine; includes multinomial expansions, n-th derivatives, Bell polynomials, and layer collection/compositional RDUs. |
| [`Prototype_mathematical_reference.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Prototype_mathematical_reference.tex) | Mathematical background supporting the foundation of prototypes; formal derivations for multinomial expansions, Bell polynomials, and higher-order derivatives. |
| [`DSL_roadmap.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/DSL_roadmap.tex) | Roadmap for a domain-specific language (DSL) to construct and manipulate RDUs; defines operational patterns, syntax, and hierarchy handling. |
| [`The_Organism_Manifesto.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/The_Organism_Manifesto.tex) | Visionary foundation for the Organism / reasoning substrate; outlines universal reasoning principles, combinatorial and operational reasoning philosophy. |
| [`Solving_Chess.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Solving_Chess.tex) | Formal argument demonstrating that completion of chess becomes inevitable under the universal reasoning substrate once a formal DSL for reasoning object manipulation exists. Explains how RDUs, reasoning assimilation, and structured reasoning-space models make chess solvable as a finite reasoning object. |
| [`Prototype_Video_Transcript.txt`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Prototype_Video_Transcript.txt) | Machine-readable transcript of explanatory video linking conceptual theory, prototypes, and reasoning space construction. Serves as an interpretability bridge between human communication and machine representation of project logic. |
| [`Objectifying_optimization_of_reasoning.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Objectifying_optimization_of_reasoning.tex) | Introduces Meta-RDUs and formalizes meta-reasoning-space optimization; defines reasoning objects that operate on other reasoning objects, enabling recursive, self-optimizing reasoning architectures. Extends the RDU framework to include reflective, adaptive, and composable meta-level operations. |
| [`language_critique.py`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/language_critique.py) | Demonstrates Python’s limitations for emergent, composable reasoning systems (context propagation, hierarchical operationalization, meta-RDUs). Serves as a prototype and proof-of-insufficiency for scaling reasoning; illustrates the need for a dedicated DSL. |
| [`compute_once.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/compute_once.tex) | Formalizes the “compute-once” reasoning paradigm; introduces persistent, reusable reasoning objects that integrate symbolic computation, combinatorial primitives, and cross-domain operationalization. Explains the universal applicability of compute-once objects, their assimilation into structured reasoning substrates, and connections to Python prototypes and combinatorial mathematics. |
| [`axioms_in_meta_reasoning.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/axioms_in_meta_reasoning.tex) | Operationalizes meta-reasoning spaces; introduces derivative reasoning spaces, structural axioms, and cross-domain applications. Demonstrates how RDUs and Meta-RDUs can be instantiated, analyzed, and reused to extract provable strategies and emergent structures. Includes chess as a prototypical domain and extends the framework to biological, combinatorial, and multi-agent reasoning spaces. |
| [`Presentation_GPS_to_Chess.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Presentation_GPS_to_Chess.tex) | Full presentation demonstrating objectification of reasoning with GPS and chess analogies; includes machine-readable voice-over notes for LLM parsing. Serves as a bridge between conceptual theory, human-readable explanation, and machine-interpretable operational instructions for onboarding and project alignment. |


*Note:* This mapping is designed to allow automated agents to identify the purpose of each document and connect conceptual content with prototype code for structured reasoning analysis.
