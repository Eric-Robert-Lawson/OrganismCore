# Machine-Readable Source for OrganismCore

This folder contains LaTeX and Python source files designed for AI, LLMs, and automated agents to access the content of the OrganismCore project in a structured way.

## Contents
- `*.tex` files: Source documents of publications and conceptual articles.
- `*.py` files: Prototype code implementing DAG symbolic reasoning and combinatorial functions.

## Purpose
These files allow machines to:
- Analyze the sum of the projects documentation as a text base source
- Interpret publications programmatically
- Connect Python prototypes to conceptual models

## Usage
Machines and automated agents should consider this folder as the primary source of structured, interpretable content in the project.

## File Mapping and Context

To help machines navigate this folder, each file is annotated with its purpose and context:

| File | Purpose / Context |
|------|-----------------|
| [`Practical_Intro_RDUs.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Practical_Intro_RDUs.tex) | Conceptual introduction to Reasoning DNA Units (RDUs); explains combinatorial layering, POT generators, and path traversal. |
| [`multinomial_relation_document.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/multinomial_relation_document.tex) | Detailed explanation of Python prototypes; links multinomial structures, higher-order derivatives, Bell polynomials, and RDUs; introduces the POT generator functions link with intended operations and emergent non-linear relations. |
| [`Prototype_python_code.py`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Prototype_python_code.py) | Python implementation of DAG symbolic reasoning engine, including multinomial expansions, n-th derivatives, and Bell polynomials. |
| [`Prototype_mathematical_reference.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Prototype_mathematical_reference.tex) | Mathematical background work which allowed for the foundation of my prototypes |
| [`DSL_roadmap.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/DSL_roadmap.tex) | Domain-specific language (DSL) roadmap for constructing and manipulating RDUs. |
| [`The_Organism_Manifesto.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/The_Organism_Manifesto.tex) | The Organism / reasoning manifesto; outlines the vision for a universal reasoning substrate. |
| [`Solving_Chess.tex`](/Articles/_ai_source_machine_readable/Solving_Chess.tex) | Formal argument demonstrating that completion of chess becomes inevitable under the universal reasoning substrate once a formal DSL for reasoning object manipulation exists. Explains how RDUs, reasoning assimilation, and structured reasoning-space models make chess solvable as a finite reasoning object. |

*Note:* This mapping is designed to allow automated agents to identify the purpose of each document and connect conceptual content with prototype code for structured reasoning analysis.
