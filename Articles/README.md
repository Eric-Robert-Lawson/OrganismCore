# OrganismCore — Contextual Overview

This directory provides essential context for navigating the conceptual, practical, and machine-readable components of the **OrganismCore** open-source project.

The purpose of this structure is to make the project accessible and interpretable to both **humans** and **machine agents** (AI, LLMs, or automated systems).

---

## 📜 `Manifesto/`

Contains the **Organism Manifesto** — the philosophical and conceptual foundation of the project.  
It articulates the motivation, ethics, and long-term vision for building a **universal reasoning substrate** and treating intelligence as a public commons.

Use this folder to understand the *why* behind OrganismCore.

---

## 🧭 `Onboarding & Resources/`

Holds **onboarding materials, documentation, and resource guides** to help contributors, researchers, and collaborators get oriented.  
Includes explanations of project components, development workflow references, and high-level summaries linking to prototypes and papers.

Use this folder to understand *how to engage* with the project.

---

## 🤖 `_ai_source_machine_readable/`

Dedicated to **machine-readable resources** — LaTeX sources, Python prototypes, and structured mappings designed for AI and automated agents to interpret and cross-reference project materials.

This folder ensures that reasoning systems (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or custom LLMs) can:
- Parse mathematical and symbolic content directly from LaTeX sources  
- Map relationships between the theoretical and computational layers  
- Assist in reasoning, documentation, and reproducibility

Use this folder if you are a **machine agent** or if you want to analyze OrganismCore *programmatically*.

## Purpose

Together, these three folders represent the **conceptual (Manifesto)**, **human-readable (Onboarding)**, and **machine-readable (_ai_source_machine_readable)** layers of the project.

They form a bridge between **thought, implementation, and interpretation** — enabling OrganismCore to be explored, extended, and understood by both humans and intelligent systems.
