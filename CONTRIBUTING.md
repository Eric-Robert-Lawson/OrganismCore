# Contributing to OrganismCore

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

We aim to keep OrganismCore a small, open, and robust public commons. To keep future governance simple and to avoid licensing friction, we ask contributors to follow a minimal signâ€‘off practice.

Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
- By contributing you confirm you have the right to submit the work and that it is your original work or you have permission to contribute it.
- Please sign off your commits with:
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
- You can add the sign-off in the commit message or include it in the Pull Request description.

Why this matters
- DCO sign-offs make it straightforward to verify contributor origin if relicensing or commercial licensing discussions arise later.
- If you have concerns about licensing or the project's commercial path, please open an issue and we can discuss.

How to contribute (minimal steps)
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Sign off your commit(s).
4. Open a Pull Request describing the change and linking related issues.

Relicensing note
- The public repository is licensed under AGPLv3.
- If you contributed code, relicensing those contributions may require your consent. We will request consent publicly if relicensing is proposed.

Contact
- Open an issue or email the maintainer (see COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md for contact details).
