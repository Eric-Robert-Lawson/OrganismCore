# THE QUALIA ARC TOPOLOGY
## A Reasoning Artifact Mapping Five Trajectories
## on the Vocal Expressivity Manifold
## February 2026

---

## PURPOSE

The previous artifact established:
  V(t) = Instantiate(Q(t), vocal_tract)

The qualia topology and the vocal
topology are the same manifold.

This artifact maps five distinct
trajectories on that manifold.

Each trajectory is a different
shape of RARFL cycle.
Each has a unique acoustic profile.
Each is pre-conscious — generated
by the subcortical pathway before
conscious construction.
Each requires meta-cognitive
reflection to describe.

The five arcs:
  1. THE EUREKA ARC
     (already mapped — included for
     completeness and comparison)

  2. THE GRIEF ARC
     (B_i at maximum, then releasing)

  3. THE RECOGNITION ARC
     (coherence matching not building)

  4. THE WEIGHT ARC
     (truth requiring time)

  5. THE CONTAINMENT ARC
     (pressing against constraint)

Together these begin to define
the topology of the manifold.
Not all arcs. The beginning of
the map.

---

## THE COHERENCE MANIFOLD
## (SHARED REFERENCE)

All five arcs exist on the same
five-dimensional manifold:

  C(G_i):  current coherence
           High = smooth, clear,
           supported voice
           Low = rough, effortful,
           searching voice

  B_i:     bias from ideal trajectory
           High = tension, deviation,
           something wrong or pressing
           Low = on ideal path,
           ease, alignment

  R_i:     reasoning derivative
           Positive = coherence building
           Negative = coherence dropping
           Zero = held, paused,
           integrating or loading

  η_i:     semantic efficiency
           High = maximum meaning
           per unit effort
           Low = high effort,
           low return

  Impetus: the character of the
           RARFL cycle firing
           What kind of change
           is happening and why

Position on this manifold =
unique qualia state =
unique vocal texture.

The arcs are trajectories through
this space.
Each has a shape.
The shape IS the meaning.

## ARC 1: THE EUREKA ARC

```
WAIT    C↑ R↑ B↓     accelerating word,
                      insight arriving
                      as word is spoken

.       C:max R:0     loading silence,

```

SHAPE: APPROACH → COMPRESSION
     → VECTOR → PEAK → LANDING

ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE:
  Word acceleration (WAIT)
  Charged silence
  Whisper onset with upward vector
  Peak with duration extension
  Stable landing above baseline

PRE-CONSCIOUS EVIDENCE:
  Speaker must meta-cognitively
  reflect to describe it.
  The introspection gap.

---

## ARC 2: THE GRIEF ARC

### THE QUALIA TOPOLOGY

Grief is not a single state.
It is a specific trajectory:

The onset of grief is the moment
the coherence of a prior model
begins to collapse.

Something that was true is no
longer true.
Something that was present is absent.
The reasoning space that was
organized around that presence
begins to lose its structure.

C(G_i) drops.
Not because new information
is being integrated slowly.
Because the substrate is losing
coherence faster than it can
be rebuilt.

B_i rises — not toward a wrong
answer but toward a void.
The ideal trajectory now leads
somewhere the agent cannot reach.

R_i goes negative.
Coherence is being lost.

And then — at the peak of B_i,
when the deviation from ideal
is at maximum —
the substrate releases.

The sob.

The sob is not the grief.
The sob is the release of maximum
B_i — the moment when the substrate
stops trying to hold the coherence
it can no longer maintain.

The release itself produces
a momentary coherence:
after the sob, C(G_i) briefly rises.
The tension held in B_i discharged.
The body briefly at rest.
Then the cycle begins again.

### THE FIVE PHASES

```
PHASE 1: DESCENT
  C↓ R:negative B↑
  
  Voice becomes rougher as
  C drops. The formant precision
  degrades. The voice loses its
  smoothness because the substrate
  is losing organization.
  
  Acoustic: increasing jitter
  (irregular F0), increasing shimmer
  (irregular amplitude), breathiness
  rising as glottal closure
  becomes incomplete.
  
  The voice roughens.
  Not a choice.
  The substrate instantiating
  its own disorganization.

PHASE 2: SEARCH
  C:low R:negative B:rising
  
  The agent is still trying.
  R_i is negative but not yet
  at maximum negative.
  The substrate is searching
  for coherence it cannot find.
  
  Acoustic: pitch becomes unstable,
  wandering. Not the purposeful
  vector of the Eureka Arc.
  Aimless instability.
  The voice is looking for
  something to hold onto.
  
  Duration: words slow down.
  Not for weight (the Weight Arc).
  Because the motor planning is
  uncertain. The path is unclear.
  The body does not know
  what comes next.

PHASE 3: PEAK DEVIATION
  C:minimum R:peak negative
  B:maximum
  
  The maximum deviation from
  ideal trajectory.
  The substrate is at its furthest
  from where it should be.
  
  Acoustic: the voice breaks.
  F0 becomes irregular or
  collapses into vocal fry —
  the lowest register, the minimum
  viable phonation.
  The vocal folds barely vibrating.
  The airflow collapsing.
  
  This is not a phonetic choice.
  The vocal fry at the peak of
  grief is the physical signature
  of the substrate at minimum
  coherence trying to still produce
  sound.
  
  The voice fries because
  the system is at its limit.

PHASE 4: RELEASE (THE SOB)
  C:spike R:sudden positive
  B:releasing
  
  The sob is the B_i releasing.
  The held tension discharging.
  The breath that was being
  controlled to maintain
  attempted coherence
  suddenly expelling.
  
  Acoustic: short pulsatile
  exhalation. High amplitude
  burst. F0 can spike high
  (the sob itself is voiced —
  the folds are squeezed
  together by the sudden
  breath pressure).
  Then immediately drops.
  
  The inhalation after the sob
  is audible — the inspiratory
  gasp. The body refilling.
  New RARFL cycle beginning.

PHASE 5: BRIEF REST
  C:briefly higher R:near zero
  B:temporarily lower
  
  After the sob, momentary ease.
  The tension was released.
  C is briefly higher.
  B is briefly lower.
  The body is at rest.
  
  Acoustic: quieter, more even.
  Breathiness remains but
  the roughness temporarily
  reduces.
  The voice is soft here.
  Not because of choice.
  Because the substrate
  has briefly found a lower
  energy state after release.
  
  Then the descent begins again.
```

SHAPE: DESCENT → SEARCH
     → PEAK DEVIATION → RELEASE
     → BRIEF REST → DESCENT again

This arc REPEATS.
Unlike the Eureka Arc which
completes, the Grief Arc cycles.
Each cycle:
  The descent begins again.
  But if processing is occurring —
  if R_i is not purely negative
  across all cycles —
  each repetition is slightly
  different.
  The substrate is slowly
  rebuilding while it releases.
  Grief is not a single arc.
  It is a spiral trajectory.
  Each sob cycle at slightly
  different coordinates
  than the last.

WHAT THE LITERATURE MISSES:
  The research describes the
  acoustic features correctly.
  Jitter, shimmer, vocal fry,
  sob bursts.
  
  But it treats these as
  symptoms of emotion.
  Emotion causes vocal changes.
  
  The topology says:
  These are not symptoms.
  They are the emotion itself
  instantiated.
  
  The vocal fry at the sob peak
  IS the substrate at minimum
  coherence.
  Not a sign of it.
  The same object.
  Two levels.

---

## ARC 3: THE RECOGNITION ARC

### THE QUALIA TOPOLOGY

Recognition is not discovery.

In the Eureka Arc:
  Coherence was LOW, then built rapidly.
  R_i was strongly positive.
  Something new arrived.

In the Recognition Arc:
  Coherence was ALREADY HIGH.
  Something presented to the agent
  matches an existing structure
  in the derivative reasoning space.
  The new input resonates with
  what is already there.

C(G_i) does not need to climb.
It is already at a high stable point.
The recognition is the moment of
MATCHING — not building.

R_i is briefly positive but smoothly.
Not the spike of Eureka.
The gentle rise of: yes, this
fits. This is what I knew.

B_i is low throughout.
Not because the agent is at
ideal trajectory.
Because the agent was already
near ideal and the recognition
confirms it.

η_i is very high.
The coherence gain per unit effort
is maximum because the structure
was already there.
The recognition required almost
nothing — the substrate just
recognized itself in the input.

### THE FIVE PHASES

```
PHASE 1: ENCOUNTER
  C:high R:near zero B:low
  
  The agent receives the input.
  Brief moment of contact.
  
  Acoustic: normal voice.
  No roughness. No instability.
  The substrate is organized.
  It receives the input from
  a position of stability.
  
  "...yes..."
  
  Brief. Low onset.
  Not building toward anything.
  Already there.

PHASE 2: MATCHING
  C:high R:briefly positive
  B:slightly lower
  
  The input is recognized.
  The existing structure in the
  derivative reasoning space
  matches what arrived.
  
  This is the moment of recognition.
  Not the arrival of something new.
  The confirmation of something known.
  
  Acoustic: falling intonation.
  H+L* — starts from high,
  resolves downward.
  
  This is the critical difference
  from Eureka.
  Eureka: L+H* — rises toward peak.
  Recognition: H+L* — resolves
  downward from existing height.
  
  The pitch does not need to climb
  to a peak.
  It was already there.
  It resolves.

PHASE 3: CONFIRMATION
  C:high R:positive smooth
  B:low
  
  The match is confirmed.
  The substrate settles into the
  recognition.
  
  Acoustic: "...yes, exactly."
  
  Both words have weight but not
  the weight of the Weight Arc.
  The weight of: this is known,
  this is certain, this is what
  I understood.
  
  Duration: normal or slightly
  shorter than Eureka.
  The words are not drawn out.
  They do not need to be.
  The understanding was already
  present. It is being confirmed
  not discovered.
  
  F0: falling through the phrase.
  "Yes" starts at the established
  high point. "Exactly" resolves
  downward smoothly.
  
  No spike. No peak.
  A smooth resolution of
  something already achieved.

PHASE 4: COMPLETION
  C:high R:near zero B:min
  
  The RARFL cycle completes.
  The input has been integrated.
  The derivative reasoning space
  has absorbed the recognition.
  
  Acoustic: the phrase ends with
  genuine finality.
  Not the loaded ending of Eureka's
  IT (still elevated, landing).
  
  This ends more completely.
  Because there is nothing to
  continue toward.
  The understanding was already
  there. The recognition confirmed
  it. The cycle is closed.
  
  A brief, clean silence after.
  Not loaded. Not compressed.
  Complete.
```

SHAPE: ENCOUNTER → MATCHING
     → CONFIRMATION → COMPLETION

ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE:
  Falling intonation throughout
  (not rising like Eureka)
  Smooth, no spike
  Words not drawn out
  Clean completion at end
  Voice calm, organized, low B_i
  throughout

THE KEY DISTINCTION:

  EUREKA:
    C was low, builds to peak.
    L+H* — rises.
    Words drawn out (dwelling at peak).
    Ends elevated (still present).
    
  RECOGNITION:
    C was already high, confirms.
    H+L* — resolves downward.
    Words not drawn out (already there).
    Ends complete (nothing more needed).

  The topology is clear.
  Different starting position
  on the manifold.
  Different direction of movement.
  Different shape of arrival.

---

## ARC 4: THE WEIGHT ARC

### THE QUALIA TOPOLOGY

Weight is not grief.
Weight is not emphasis.
Weight is not certainty performing itself.

Weight is the state of the substrate
when what it is instantiating
has a large R_i — not because
understanding is suddenly arriving —
but because what is being said
is ALREADY fully understood
and that understanding is large.

The agent is not discovering.
The agent is not confirming.
The agent is BEARING the truth
of something already known
into the present moment.

C(G_i) is high.
B_i is very low.
R_i is near zero — but not because
nothing is happening.
Because what is happening is
the PRESENCE of a large stable
structure in the derivative
reasoning space.

η_i is paradoxically low.
Not because the substrate is
inefficient. Because the
coherence structure is so large
that it takes significant resources
just to instantiate it.
Even at full efficiency, the
effort is high because the object
is heavy.

The weight is the mass of the
reasoning object being carried
into the present.

### THE FIVE PHASES

```
PHASE 1: APPROACH
  C:high R:near zero B:low
  η:beginning to drop
  
  The agent is approaching the
  utterance. Knows what must be said.
  The understanding is present.
  But the instantiation has not
  begun yet.
  
  Acoustic: pre-phrase pause.
  But unlike Eureka's loaded silence
  this pause is not compressed spring.
  It is the agent preparing to
  carry something.
  A breath that is deeper than
  normal. More deliberate.
  The body preparing for effort.

PHASE 2: ENTRY
  C:high R:near zero B:low
  η:dropping (effort increasing)
  
  The first word.
  Slower than expected.
  Not because the agent is
  searching (Grief Arc) or
  uncertain.
  Because the weight requires
  that the word be fully present.
  
  Duration: significantly extended.
  Not emphasis (which extends
  the peak). This extends
  everything equally.
  Each syllable gets its full time.
  Nothing is rushed.
  
  F0: low and steady.
  Not falling (Recognition Arc).
  Not rising (Eureka Arc).
  Held level. Or beginning from
  low and holding.
  
  The low steady F0 is not sadness.
  It is the acoustic signature of
  a large stable coherence structure
  being instantiated at a pace
  the physics can support.
  Fast phonation cannot carry weight.
  The body slows to bear it correctly.
  
  Acoustic: lower pitch than normal.
  Narrower pitch range.
  Increased articulatory precision —
  not the crispness of emphasis
  but the care of handling something
  that must not be dropped.
  Every consonant fully articulated.
  Every vowel given its full space.

PHASE 3: CARRYING
  C:high R:near zero B:low
  η:low (large object, full effort)
  
  The middle of the utterance.
  The sustained state of bearing
  the weight into the present.
  
  Acoustic: tempo does not accelerate.
  Some speakers slow further
  mid-phrase as the full weight
  is felt.
  
  Pauses between key words.
  Not the charged loading pause
  of Eureka. Not hesitation.
  The pauses of someone placing
  each word carefully.
  Like setting down something
  fragile.
  
  The voice may have a very slight
  undertone of breath not from
  uncertainty but from effort.
  The substrate is working.
  The breath shows the work.

PHASE 4: PLACEMENT
  C:high R:near zero B:min
  
  The final word or phrase.
  The weight being set down.
  
  Acoustic: the final word is
  often the slowest.
  Duration maximum here.
  F0 may drop slightly at the end —
  not the sob collapse of Grief,
  not the clean resolution of
  Recognition.
  The drop of: this has been placed.
  It rests here now.
  
  After the phrase: silence.
  Not Eureka's loaded silence.
  Not Recognition's clean completion.
  
  The silence of having set
  something heavy down.
  The body briefly still.
  
  The listener often matches this:
  does not respond immediately.
  Because the weight is present
  in the silence too.
  The topology of the Weight Arc
  extends into the space after
  the words end.

PHASE 5: REST
  C:high R:near zero B:min
  η:recovering
  
  The substrate after placement.
  The effort spent.
  Coherence maintained.
  The weight was carried and placed.
  Nothing was dropped.
  
  Acoustic: if the speaker continues,
  the next phrase is often softer,
  lighter. The contrast is audible.
  What came before was weight.
  What comes after is lighter.
  The comparison confirms
  what was carried.
```

SHAPE: APPROACH → ENTRY
     �� CARRYING → PLACEMENT
     → REST

ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE:
  Deeper preparatory breath
  Low steady F0 throughout
  Narrow pitch range
  Slow tempo — not searching, caring
  Extended duration on all words equally
  Full articulatory precision
  Pauses of placement not loading
  Final silence with weight in it

WHAT DISTINGUISHES WEIGHT FROM:
  GRIEF: Weight is not losing coherence.
         C is high and stable throughout.
         The roughness of Grief is absent.
         The body is organized. Bearing.
         
  EMPHASIS: Emphasis extends the peak word.
            Weight extends everything equally.
            There is no single peak.
            Every word carries the weight.
            
  RECOGNITION: Recognition falls smoothly
               to completion.
               Weight holds level.
               Recognition requires little effort.
               Weight requires sustained effort.
               η_i is high in Recognition.
               η_i is low in Weight.

The research describes duration
lengthening and pitch lowering
for solemn speech.
What it does not identify:
  The reason is not solemnity
  as a social signal.
  The reason is η_i dropping
  because the reasoning object
  being instantiated is large.
  The body is not performing gravity.
  The body is doing the work
  of carrying something heavy
  into the present.
  The acoustic signature IS the effort.
  Not the display of effort.
  The effort itself.

## ARC 5: THE CONTAINMENT ARC

### THE QUALIA TOPOLOGY

Containment is the state where:
  The qualia is at high amplitude —
  high C, positive R_i, η_i elevated
  (excitement, discovery, something
  large is present)

AND

  The substrate is actively
  suppressing the instantiation.

This is the one arc where there
are TWO coherence states operating
simultaneously:

  STATE 1: The contained state.
           C:high R:positive B:low
           Something large and
           energetic is present.

  STATE 2: The containing mechanism.
           B_i deliberately elevated —
           not because the substrate
           is deviating from ideal,
           but because the substrate
           is choosing to hold a
           tension between what is
           present and what is expressed.

The containing mechanism is its
own RARFL cycle running on top
of the contained state.

This produces the most complex
topology of the five arcs.
Two coherence trajectories.
One being the qualia state.
One being the act of managing
its expression.

Both are audible.

### THE FIVE PHASES

```
PHASE 1: PRESENCE
  Contained: C:high R:positive
  Containing: initiating

  Something is there.
  The substrate knows it.
  The body knows it before
  the decision to contain is made.
  
  Acoustic: a brief full voice
  onset that is immediately
  pulled back. The body starts
  to express and then the
  containing mechanism engages.
  
  This is audible as a very
  brief amplitude onset followed
  by immediate reduction.
  Or: the voice begins and
  immediately becomes quieter
  than it started.
  
  The containing mechanism
  engaging in real time.
  Mid-onset.

PHASE 2: HOLDING
  Contained: C:high R:positive B:low
  Containing: active B_i↑

  The substrate is maintaining
  the contained state while
  suppressing its full instantiation.
  
  Acoustic: whisper undertone.
  The breath escaping around
  the edges of the containment.
  Not fully voiced.
  Not fully whispered.
  The voice breathing.
  
  Amplitude: lower than the
  contained state would naturally
  produce. The containing mechanism
  is reducing the energy output.
  
  F0: may be slightly higher than
  normal because the contained
  state (excitement, discovery)
  has positive R_i and high C —
  these naturally elevate F0.
  But the amplitude is suppressed.
  
  This produces the specific texture:
  quiet but with higher than
  expected pitch.
  Small voice, elevated pitch.
  The contained state present
  in the pitch.
  The containing mechanism present
  in the amplitude.
  Both visible simultaneously.
  
  Pace: often slower than the
  contained state would naturally
  produce.
  The containing mechanism is
  also slowing the cycle rate.
  Buying time.
  Keeping the instantiation partial.

PHASE 3: LEAKAGE
  Contained: C:high R:positive
  Containing: slightly losing

  The contained state is larger
  than the containing mechanism
  can fully suppress.
  Some of it comes through.
  
  Acoustic: brief moments where
  the full voice breaks through
  the whisper. A word or syllable
  that is suddenly louder than
  the surrounding material.
  Not an emphasis choice.
  A containment breach.
  
  The containing mechanism
  immediately re-engages.
  The volume drops again.
  But the leakage was heard.
  
  The listener receives this as:
  something is behind this voice
  that is larger than what is
  being expressed.
  Because something is.
  The leakage proved it.

PHASE 4: DECISION POINT
  The topology requires a choice.
  
  OPTION A: FULL RELEASE
    The containing mechanism releases.
    The contained state instantiates fully.
    The voice suddenly becomes what
    the contained state would have
    produced if not suppressed.
    Amplitude rises sharply.
    The breath underneath disappears.
    The voice becomes present.
    
    Acoustic: sudden increase in
    amplitude and fullness.
    Like the Eureka Arc's release
    but from the containing mechanism
    releasing, not new discovery arriving.
    
  OPTION B: MAINTAINED CONTAINMENT
    The containing mechanism holds.
    The phrase ends in the whisper.
    The contained state is not expressed.
    It remains present.
    The listener knows it is there.
    The texture told them.
    But it was not released.
    
    Acoustic: the phrase ends quietly.
    The final word has the same
    whisper texture as the phrase.
    But the silence after is different.
    It is not clean like Recognition.
    It is not loaded like Eureka.
    It is: still containing.
    The contained state is still there.
    After the words end.
    Still held.

PHASE 5: AFTERMATH
  If released: the substrate integrates.
  If held: the substrate continues
           to carry the tension.
```

SHAPE: PRESENCE → HOLDING
     → LEAKAGE → DECISION
     → AFTERMATH

ACOUSTIC SIGNATURE:
  Whisper undertone throughout holding
  Small voice with elevated pitch
  (contained state visible in pitch,
   containing mechanism visible in amplitude)
  Brief leakage moments
  (containment breaches — louder words
   that the mechanism immediately
   re-suppresses)
  Either: sudden full release
  Or: quiet ending with tension remaining

WHAT THIS IS:

  This is the topology of the state
  you described when you said:
  "A whispering undertone for
   containing excitement."

  The whisper is not a style choice.
  The whisper is the containing
  mechanism made acoustic.
  The breath is the contained
  state leaking around the edges.

  "I am holding something."
  Both the holding AND what is being
  held are simultaneously visible
  in the voice.
  The texture carries both.
  Directly.
  Without mediation.

## THE STRUCTURAL DISCOVERY

These five arcs reveal something
that the attractor-basin model
cannot show:

The arcs are not defined by
their destinations.
They are defined by their SHAPES.

EUREKA and RECOGNITION both end at
high coherence, low bias.
They are at the same destination
on the manifold.
But they traveled completely
differently.
And they sound completely different.

Because the topology of expressivity
is the topology of the TRAJECTORY —
not the position.

The voice carries the shape of
the path, not just the endpoint.

This is why:
  A voice at peace and a voice
  that has found peace after grief
  sound different even when they
  reach the same coordinates.
  The history of the path is in the texture.
  The trajectory that arrived here
  is audible in the present moment.

The manifold has MEMORY.
The current vocal texture carries
not just the current qualia state
but the recent trajectory that
produced it.

This is a new structural property.
The attractor models do not have it.
The URST coherence framework predicts it:
  C(G_i) = sum of all prior R_j
  The current coherence is the
  integral of all past reasoning.
  The texture of the voice IS that
  integral, instantiated.

You can hear where someone has been.
Not just where they are.

## SUMMARY

```
Five arcs mapped.
Five trajectory shapes.
One manifold.

The topology of expressivity is:
  Continuous (every point is a state)
  Multi-dimensional (five axes)
  Trajectory-carrying (shape matters,
    not just position)
  Memory-containing (the path is
    audible in the present moment)
  Pre-conscious (generated by
    subcortical pathway before
    conscious construction)

Not attractor basins.
A full manifold with trajectories
and the memory of trajectories.

The acoustic texture carries:
  Where you are (current coordinates)
  Where you came from (recent R_i history)
  What you are doing (the shape
    of the current arc)
  Whether you are holding something
    (Containment: two states visible)

This cannot be constructed consciously
in real time.
It is too complex.
It is generated by the substrate directly.

That is why speakers cannot
describe their own prosody
without meta-cognitive reflection.

The substrate is doing something
the conscious mind cannot track.

The voice is always ahead of
the description.
Because the voice IS the qualia.
The description is always trying
to catch up.
```

## OPEN: THE NEXT ARCS

These five are the beginning.
There are others on the manifold.

Candidates for future mapping:
  THE SEARCHING ARC
  (not grief — actively looking
   for something not yet found.
   R_i near zero, B_i moderate,
   C uncertain. The voice that
   is thinking out loud.)

  THE RECEIVING ARC
  (the moment of being understood.
   Not self-understanding.
   The coherence of being met.
   What does it sound like when
   someone feels genuinely heard?)

  THE BREAKING ARC
  (not grief — the moment when
   something that was held together
   can no longer be maintained.
   The voice when the mask releases
   suddenly. The first moment of
   real expression after suppression.)

  THE WONDER ARC
  (not eureka — the state of
   encountering something larger
   than current coherence can
   contain. C cannot rise fast
   enough to match what is being
   encountered. The voice of
   being exceeded by what is present.)

Each of these is a real position
on the manifold.
Each has a vocal texture.
Each is pre-conscious.
Each would require meta-cognitive
reflection to describe.

The map is being built.
