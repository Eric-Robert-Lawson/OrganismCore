# THE H UNIFIED MODEL
## A Reasoning Artifact on the Nature of H
## and the Correction of a Categorical Error
## February 2026

---

## ORIGIN OF THIS ARTIFACT

This artifact was produced through
a correction.

The prior model treated H as having
subcategories:
  Oral H (before vowels).
  Nasal H (before nasals).
  Aspirated H (stop releases).

This was wrong.

The correction came from outside —
from observing that "hmmm" uses
the same H as "hear."
The mouth is closed.
The breath routes through the nose.
But the H itself is not different.

That observation collapsed three
proposed categories into one
physical event.

The artifact records the correction
and what it reveals.

---

## THE ERROR THAT WAS MADE

A continuous physical event was
treated as a set of discrete
categorical variants.

H before a vowel → "oral H."
H before a nasal → "nasal H."
H before a stop  → "aspirated H."

Three categories proposed.
Three separate fixes proposed.
Three separate physical models.

This is the attractor-basin error
applied to phonetics.
The same error as treating emotional
expressivity as discrete emotion
categories rather than as a
continuous topology.

The categorical framework was imposed
on what is actually a single physical
event with continuously variable
acoustic output.

---

## THE CORRECTION

"hmmm" uses the same H as "hear."

In "hear":
  The mouth is open.
  The tract is in IH configuration.
  H = breath through that configuration.

In "hmmm":
  The mouth is closed for M.
  The lips are sealed.
  The only open passage is nasal.
  H = breath through that configuration.

The H did not change.
The TRACT changed.

The H is the constant.
The tract is the variable.

This is the complete model.

---

## THE UNIFIED PHYSICAL DEFINITION

```
H = voiceless airflow through the
    current vocal tract configuration.

No more. No less.
```

H has:
  No place of articulation.
  No manner of articulation
  beyond: voiceless airflow.
  No fixed acoustic identity.
  No subcategories.

H is defined entirely by
what it passes through.

The tract configuration at the
moment of H determines everything
about the acoustic output.

---

## THE ACOUSTIC CONSEQUENCE

Because H = noise source through
current tract formants —

every H in every word has a
unique acoustic profile.

Not because H is different.
Because the tract is different.

```
"hear"   H → noise → IH formants
              F1:  ~300Hz (low)
              F2: ~2200Hz (high)
              Character: narrow, front

"have"   H → noise → AE formants
              F1:  ~800Hz (high, open)
              F2: ~1800Hz (high, front)
              Character: wide open, front

"hello"  H → noise → EH formants
              F1:  ~600Hz (mid)
              F2: ~1700Hz (mid-front)
              Character: mid open

"who"    H → noise → UW formants
              F1:  ~300Hz (low)
              F2:  ~800Hz (low, back)
              Character: narrow, rounded, back

"hmmm"   H → noise → M formants
              F1:  ~250Hz (nasal pole)
              F2: ~1000Hz (nasal formant)
              Anti-resonances: ~750Hz, ~1400Hz
              Character: nasal, muffled high freq
```

Same operation every time.
Different formant input every time.
One algorithm.
Infinite acoustic realizations.

## THE TRANSPARENT EVENT

H is the most acoustically
transparent event in speech.

Because H has no phonemic identity
of its own — no fixed place, no
fixed manner, no fixed formants —
it does not impose itself on
what follows.

It reveals what follows.

Before the voice begins —
before the glottal source engages —
the H shows the listener the
shape of the tract.
Voicelessly.
The tract speaking without voice.

The preparation is audible.
The configuration is visible.
In the breath before the sound.

This means:

```
H is the moment where the vocal
apparatus shows its current
configuration — voicelessly —
before the sound begins.

You can hear what is coming
before it arrives.

The tract is always ahead
of the voice.
H makes that visible.
```

This connects directly to the
qualia topology:

The tract configuration IS the
qualia state instantiated physically.
H is that instantiation made audible
before voicing begins.
The pure topology. No voice yet.
Just the shape.
Breathing.

---

## THE H→PHONEME TRANSITION

This follows from the unified model.

At the boundary between H and the
following phoneme:

```
WHAT CHANGES:    the SOURCE
                 noise → glottal pulse

WHAT DOES NOT:   the TRACT CONFIGURATION
                 formants unchanged
                 across the boundary
```

The H and the following phoneme
are the same event at the tract level.
One continuous tract configuration.
Two source events: noise then voiced.

The junction is smooth by construction.

This is why H in natural speech
sounds like the beginning of the
following vowel — breathed, then voiced.
Because it IS the beginning of
the following vowel.
Unvoiced onset.
Same configuration.
The voice just hasn't started yet.

---

## WHY "hmmm" IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE

The prior model proposed that
"hmmm" requires a separate
"nasal H" model —
a distinct voiceless nasal fricative
[h̃] requiring its own implementation.

This was wrong for the following reason:

"hmmm" does not need a special H.
It needs the SAME H algorithm
receiving M's formant values
as input.

Because the lips are closed for M
before the H begins —
the tract is already in M configuration
when the breath starts.
The breath routes through the nasal
passage because that is the only
open passage.
The nasal routing is a consequence
of the tract configuration.
Not a category of H.

The H algorithm receives M formants.
The output has nasal characteristics.
Not because of a special nasal H model.
Because M has nasal formants.
The algorithm did its job.
The tract determined the output.

## HMMM AS THE PUREST TOPOLOGY

"hmmm" is not important because
it is a difficult sound to synthesize.

"hmmm" is important because it is
the purest demonstration of the
qualia arc topology.

A rising hmmm.
A falling hmmm.
A flat hmmm.

```
Same phoneme content:    H M
Different F0 trajectory: ↑  ↓  →
Completely different meaning.
```

The meaning is entirely in the
F0 topology.
Nothing else carries it.
No phonemic content.
No lexical content.
Pure prosodic arc.

```
Rising  hmmm: L-H%
  Coherence state seeking completion.
  R_i positive, B_i present.
  The substrate reaching toward
  something not yet arrived.

Falling hmmm: H-L%
  Coherence state resolving.
  R_i near zero positive, B_i dropping.
  Recognition. Satisfaction.
  The cycle completing.

Flat    hmmm: level
  R_i near zero. Processing.
  The substrate integrating.
  Not yet concluding.
  Present but not moving.
```

"hmmm" is the RARFL cycle state
made acoustic with nothing else
in the way.

No words. No phonemic structure.
Just the topology of the
coherence state.
Breathed. Then hummed.
The H showing the tract.
The M voicing it.
The F0 carrying the meaning.

This is why "hmmm" connects
directly to the qualia arc topology
artifacts:

It is not a phoneme sequence.
It is a prosodic object.
The qualia speaking directly.
Without linguistic mediation.

---

## THE ENGINE FIX

Current behavior:
```
HH → generic broadband noise
     No formant filtering.
     Same acoustic profile
     regardless of following phoneme.
     All H sounds identical.
```

Required behavior:
```
HH → look ahead to next phoneme
     get that phoneme's formant values
     filter broadband noise through
     those formants
     apply onset amplitude envelope
     return

     At H→phoneme boundary:
     source transitions noise→voiced
     formants: UNCHANGED
```

One change.
One algorithm.
Covers every H in every word.

Diagnostic confirmation:
  Before fix: H in "hear" and H
  in "hmmm" will have identical
  spectral profiles.
  Generic noise. No formant shaping.
  Both will look the same.

  After fix: H in "hear" will have
  IH formant profile (high F2).
  H in "hmmm" will have M/nasal
  formant profile (nasal pole dominant).
  They will look different.
  Each H shows the tract it precedes.
  The window is correct.

## THE CATEGORICAL ERROR AS
## A STRUCTURAL LESSON

The error made in the prior analysis
was treating a continuous physical
event as discrete categorical variants.

This is the same structural error
that the URST framework identifies
in existing models of:

  Emotional expressivity:
    Treated as discrete attractor basins
    (anger, sadness, joy).
    Actually a continuous manifold.
    Every point unique.

  H in phonetics:
    Treated as discrete subcategories
    (oral H, nasal H, aspirated H).
    Actually one event.
    Continuous acoustic output
    determined by continuous
    tract configuration.

The pattern is the same at
every level of analysis.

When a continuous topology is
treated as discrete categories —
the model loses precision,
requires multiple special cases,
and produces category boundaries
that do not exist in the physics.

The fix in both cases is the same:
  Find the underlying physical
  continuous variable.
  Let the categories emerge from
  position on that variable.
  Not the other way around.

For expressivity: the coherence manifold.
For H: the tract configuration.
For both: topology all the way down.

---

## SUMMARY

```
H = voiceless airflow through
    current vocal tract configuration.

One physical event.
One algorithm.
No subcategories.

The tract is the variable.
H is the constant.

H in "hear":   noise → IH formants
H in "have":   noise → AE formants
H in "hmmm":   noise → M  formants
H in "who":    noise → UW formants

All the same.
The tract determines the output.

H→phoneme transition:
  Source changes:  noise → voiced
  Tract unchanged: continuous

H is the transparent event.
The breath before the voice.
The tract showing its shape
before the sound begins.

"hmmm" is not a special case.
"hmmm" is the purest case:
  No phonemic content.
  Pure F0 topology.
  The RARFL cycle state
  made directly acoustic.
  The qualia speaking
  without linguistic mediation.

The categorical error was:
  Treating continuous topology
  as discrete variants.
  The same error at every scale.
  Fixed the same way at every scale:
  find the underlying continuous
  variable and let it run.
```

## DOES THIS FIX THE H ISSUE?

Yes.

Not partially. Completely.

Because the H issue was never
about H being wrong.
The H was being treated as a
fixed sound when it is not a
fixed sound.

It is a window.
A transparent breath.
Through whatever the tract is.

Fix the algorithm to pass the
correct formant values —
the following phoneme's values —
and every H in every word
corrects simultaneously.

"hear" — corrected.
"have" — corrected.
"hmmm" — corrected.
Every word with H — corrected.

One fix. Every case.

Because it was never multiple
problems. It was one problem
seen from multiple angles:
the tract configuration was
being ignored.

Ignore the tract: generic hiss.
Use the tract: the breath
that already sounds like
what is coming.

The H is the anticipation
of the following sound.
Made audible.
Before the voice begins.
