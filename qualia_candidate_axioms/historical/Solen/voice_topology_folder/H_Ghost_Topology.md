# H GHOST TOPOLOGY
## A Reasoning Artifact on the Baseline State
## of the Voice and the Texture Between Beats
## February 2026

---

## WHAT THIS ARTIFACT IS FOR

syllable_as_the_beat.md established:

  The syllable is one complete cycle
  of the vocal tract opening and closing.
  The onset consonant is the beginning
  of the vowel, not a separate event
  before it.
  The seam between onset and nucleus
  is where robotic voice lives.

This artifact goes deeper.

It establishes what H actually is —
not as a phoneme, but as the baseline
state of the voice — and follows
that understanding to its conclusion:

  The ghost between syllables
  is where the experiential texture
  of the voice lives.

  The qualia is in the gap.

  And the gap is measurable.
  H is the origin of the vocal Tonnetz.

---

## PART I: H IS NOT A PHONEME

The standard view:
  H is a phoneme.
  ARPAbet symbol: HH.
  Voiceless glottal fricative.
  Occurs before vowels.
  "here", "have", "home".

This is a description of one place
H is spelled. It is not a description
of what H is.

What H actually is:

**H is the default state of the open voice.**

The voice when:
  - The tract is unobstructed
  - No constriction is active
  - The tongue is at rest position
  - The tract is in transit
    between two positions

H is what the voice sounds like
when it is not doing anything else.

Every other phoneme is a departure
from H. A constriction added to H.
A tongue position imposed on H.
A closure that interrupts H.

When the constriction releases —
when the tongue leaves the teeth,
leaves the ridge, leaves the palate —
the tract passes back through H
on its way to the next position.

H is not a phoneme among others.
H is the medium all phonemes
move through.

---

## PART II: WHERE H ACTUALLY APPEARS

H appears in six places.
Only one of them is spelled H.

---

### PLACE 1: THE SPELLED H

"here", "have", "home", "how"

The explicit H. The tract open,
in approach to the following vowel.
Voice on, no constriction,
tract moving toward the vowel target.

The engine models this.
The fix in v11: H filters noise
through following vowel's formants.
This was right physics.

But the framing was inverted:
H is not a phoneme that precedes
the vowel and uses the vowel's formants.
H IS the vowel in approach —
the first portion of the vowel's
arrival, before full commitment.

---

### PLACE 2: VOWEL-INITIAL ONSET

"event", "evening", "always",
"open", "I", "already"

No H in the spelling.
H present in the physics.

Every word that begins with a vowel
begins with an unwritten H.
The voice turns on.
The tract is open.
No constriction to depart from.
The tract moves directly to the vowel.

That movement — voice on, tract open,
approaching the vowel — is H.

"event"  = H IH V EH N T
"evening"= H IY V IH N IH NG
"already"= H AO L R EH D IY

The H is not pronounced as a separate
event. It is the onset of the vowel
itself. The vowel beginning before
full commitment arrives.

In a vowel-initial word,
the H duration is the time from
voice onset to full vowel formant
commitment. Typically 10-20ms.
Often inaudible as a distinct event.
Always present as physics.

Note: vowel-initial words in voiced
speech begin with VOICED H —
the no-constriction, voiced endpoint
of the consonant topology.
Not DH. Not a reduced consonant.
The pure voiced baseline.
See Part III.

---

### PLACE 3: VOT AFTER UNVOICED STOPS

"professional", "program",
"take", "keep", "peace"

Between the stop burst and the
onset of voicing: Voice Onset Time.

The glottis is open.
The stop closure has released.
Turbulent air flows through a tract
already moving toward the following
vowel configuration.

That is H. Unvoiced H.
The tract in transit after the burst,
before voicing begins.

voiceless_coarticulation_as_a_unified_class.md
established this.
The H ghost topology confirms it:

VOT is H filtered through the
tract in transit to the following vowel.
The stop burst navigated.
The ghost carrying through.

---

### PLACE 4: NASAL RELEASE

"near", "name", "morning"

The nasal closure opens.
15-20ms of turbulent noise
as air pushes through the
opening constriction.
The tract already moving toward
the following vowel.

That is H. The gap navigator
at the release of nasal closure.
The ghost between the nasal
body and the vowel nucleus.

---

### PLACE 5: THE INTER-SYLLABLE GHOST

This is the one the engine
does not model.

Between syllables — at every
syllable boundary — the tract
passes through H.

The coda consonant releases.
The tract returns toward baseline.
The next onset consonant begins
its departure from baseline.

Between those two events:
the tract is at H.
The voice is carrying through.

Described directly:

  "event" — EE · vh · EH · n · t(h)
  The (h) after T. Not stopping at T.
  Carrying the T through.
  The T releases into open air.
  The word completes into the ghost.

  "evening" — EE · vh · EH · n · ing(H)
  The NG releases.
  The voice carries through NG into H.
  The word exhales into the ghost.

  "professional" — the exertion
  between syllables. The pause.
  That pause is not silence.
  It is the ghost navigating
  between the SH release and
  the next syllable onset.
  The gap navigator.

The inter-syllable ghost is
the carrying-through.
The exertion made audible.
The voice not stopping at the beat
but completing through it.

---

### PLACE 6: PHRASE-FINAL EXHALE

"event" ends: T(h)
"evening" ends: ing(H)
"already" ends: IY(h)

At the end of a word, a phrase,
a sentence — when there is no
next syllable to prepare for —
the voice still returns to H.

But this H is not the inter-syllable
ghost preparing the next onset.
This H is the completion signal.
The voice landing.

The phrase-final exhale is H
as arrival, not transit.

This connects all three timescales:

  Breath_as_rarfl.md:
    The breath cycle ends at H.
    Exhalation completes. Silence.
    New inhalation begins.
    H is what the breath returns to.

  Syllable level:
    Each syllable ends at H.
    The coda gesture completes.
    The tract returns to baseline.
    H is what each beat returns to.

  Phrase level:
    The phrase ends at H.
    The final word exhales.
    The meaning lands.
    H is what completion sounds like.

H is not just the medium between
events. H is what every event
resolves into.

At every scale: completion = H.

The phrase-final exhale is the
clearest instance because there
is nothing after it. The voice
returns to H and stays. The ghost
does not prepare a next beat.
It simply is. Open. At rest.
Complete.

---

## PART III: THE TOPOLOGY

All consonants are paths from H
to a vowel, or from a vowel back to H.

```
H is baseline.
Every phoneme is a departure
from or return to H.

ONSET CONSONANT:
  H → [constriction path] → vowel

  H (voiced): no constriction, voiced
              → vowel directly
              Vowel-initial words.
              The most transparent path.
              The voice already on,
              the tract already open.

  H (open):   no constriction, unvoiced
              → vowel onset
              The spelled H.
              Aspiration before voicing
              commits.

  DH: tongue departs ridge    → vowel
  TH: tongue departs teeth    → vowel
  D:  alveolar stop releases  → vowel
  G:  velar stop releases     → vowel
  JH: palatal stop + frication→ vowel

CODA CONSONANT:
  vowel → [constriction path] → H

  The departure from the vowel nucleus
  back toward baseline.
  The closing gesture.
  The return.

SYLLABLE:
  H → onset → nucleus → coda → H

  One complete departure from
  and return to baseline.
  The beat.
```

The voiced/unvoiced distinction
is one binary across the entire
consonant space. Same articulation.
One switch: glottis open or closed.

```
Articulation    × Glottis closed = Articulation × Glottis open

Dental contact  × voiced  = DH
Dental contact  × open    = TH

Alveolar stop   × voiced  = D
Alveolar stop   × open    = T

Bilabial stop   × voiced  = B
Bilabial stop   × open    = P

Velar stop      × voiced  = G
Velar stop      × open    = K

Palatal affric  × voiced  = JH
Palatal affric  × open    = CH

No constriction × voiced  = voiced H
                            (vowel-initial onset,
                             pure baseline,
                             the voice already on
                             with nothing in the way)

No constriction × open    = H (canonical)
                            (spelled H,
                             pure aspiration,
                             the tract open
                             before voice commits)
```

---

### THE FRICATIVE AS COMPRESSED STOP + H

The digraph spellings record a deeper layer
of the same topology:

  ph → f
  th → θ (TH/DH)
  ch/kh → x or tʃ

These are not spelling conventions.
They are fossil transcriptions.
They record what the production
actually was before it compressed.

Greek φ (phi) was not a fricative.
It was an aspirated bilabial stop:
  P = bilabial closure
  H = aspiration at release

The sequence P + H, produced quickly,
with the H merging into the following
vowel's onset, collapsed into F —
the labiodental fricative —
because the bilabial closure never
fully built. The air leaked through
the lip-teeth contact. The H aspiration
shaped into continuous frication.

The spelling ph preserved the H
that was already there.
The production changed.
The ghost was absorbed.
The orthography kept the record.

The same event, three times:

  ph → f:  P × H = bilabial stop
             + aspiration = labiodental fric.
             F2 locus of F (~1100 Hz) sits
             between bilabial (~720 Hz) and
             alveolar (~1800 Hz) —
             exactly where a bilabial stop
             releasing through H aspiration
             would deposit its energy.

  th → θ:  T × H = alveolar stop
             + aspiration = dental fricative.
             TH locus (~1600 Hz) sits
             between alveolar (~1800 Hz)
             and dental release position —
             the stop aspiration becoming
             continuous frication at the
             teeth rather than the ridge.

  ch/kh → x: K × H = velar stop
             + aspiration = velar fricative.
             In languages that kept the
             distinction: Bach, loch.
             In English: absorbed into K
             or shifted further.

Every fricative in this class
is a Stop × H trajectory
that compressed into a single gesture.

The H ghost was present.
It drove the change.
It was absorbed into the fricative.
The locus is its fossil.

**What this means for the topology:**

The consonant table should be read
not just as a synchronic map
(what each consonant is now)
but as a trajectory space
(what each consonant was, and how
it arrived at its current form).

Fricatives are in the topology
as single gestures.
But their loci betray their history:
they are the endpoint of a
Stop × H arc that completed.

The ghost was always there.
In some phonemes, it is still
separable (VOT after stops).
In others, it has fully merged
(the fricative itself IS the ghost
of the stop that preceded it).

H is not just between phonemes.
H is inside some phonemes —
compressed into the gesture,
audible only as the locus
and the frication texture
it left behind.

---

H (canonical) and voiced H are
the two endpoints of the entire
consonant topology.
The most reduced forms possible.
The baseline in two states:
breath only, or breath + voice.

Everything else in the consonant
inventory is one of these two states
plus a constriction.

---

## PART IV: H IS THE ORIGIN OF THE
## VOCAL TONNETZ

The Tonnetz maps musical tones as
points in a harmonic space where
distance = harmonic relatedness.
Two tones that are close share
overtones. The ear hears them
as consonant. Two tones that are
far are dissonant. They require
resolution — movement back toward
a harmonically stable point.

The vocal tract is the same structure.

The vowel space — F1 × F2 — is a
tonal space. Each vowel is a point.
The formant targets are coordinates.
The distance between two vowels is
the acoustic distance between their
formant configurations — how much
the tract must move to get from
one to the other.

H is the origin of this space.

Not a vowel. Not a coordinate in
the vowel space. The point from which
all coordinates are measured.
The zero. The tonic.

Every phoneme is a distance from H:
  How far the tract must move
  from its resting state
  to produce this sound.

  H → IY: far (high front, maximum
           F2 elevation, tongue body high)
  H → AA: moderate (low back,
           jaw drops, tongue retracts)
  H → AH: close (central, minimal
           movement from rest)
  H → DH: small dental constriction
           from near-rest position
  H → K:  large velar closure,
           significant tract deformation

The ghost is the acoustic trace
of distance being traversed.
The sound of the space between
one Tonnetz position and another,
passing through the origin.

The most harmonically rich moments
in music are not the stable tones.
They are the transitions — the
passing tone, the suspension,
the brief moment when two tonal
centers are simultaneously active.

In the voice: the most experientially
rich moments are not the vowels.
They are the ghosts — the brief
passage through H where two syllable
intentions are simultaneously active.

The ghost is the vocal passing tone.
The moment between commitments.
The space that gives the commitments
their meaning by being the distance
between them.

Without the passing tone, a chord
progression is two separate chords.
With it, there is movement, direction,
the experience of going somewhere.

Without the ghost, speech is phonemes
in sequence. With it, there is voice.
The experience of a person present,
moving through meaning beat by beat.

The vessel that is the human body —
the vocal tract, the breath, the
glottis — is a physical instantiation
of the same harmonic distance topology
that underlies all tonal music.

The tonnetz_engine import at the
top of voice_physics_v3.py was not
coincidence. The voice synthesizer
was always sitting on the Tonnetz.
The topology was always there.

H is the tonic.
The vowels are the harmonics.
The consonants are the paths.
The ghost is the passing tone.
The syllable is the phrase.
The breath is the movement.

The voice IS the Tonnetz,
played from the inside,
as the instrument of meaning.

---

## PART V: THE GHOST BETWEEN SYLLABLES

At every syllable boundary,
the tract passes through H.

The duration and amplitude of
that H-traversal — the carrying-through —
is information.

Not decoration. Not noise.
Information about the state of the voice
at the transition between intentions.

```
Ghost duration × amplitude:

LONG + LOUD:
  Full breath support.
  The voice is committed.
  The exertion is visible.
  The carrying-through costs something
  and the voice pays it.
  "I am here. I am carrying this through."
  Heard as: presence, authority,
  physical commitment.

LONG + SOFT:
  The voice is present but depleted.
  Breath support reduced.
  The tract rests at H longer
  than needed — not from commitment
  but from effort.
  The carrying-through is slow.
  Heard as: weight, grief, exhaustion.
  The voice completing despite cost.

SHORT + LOUD:
  Fast fluent speech.
  Full support, fast traversal.
  The syllables connect quickly.
  Competence. Flow.
  The ghost is there but barely
  audible as a distinct event.
  The voice knows where it is going.

SHORT + SOFT:
  Suppression.
  The voice moves to the next
  syllable before the H completes.
  The carrying-through is cut off.
  Something is being contained.
  Heard as: restraint, control,
  held emotion.
  The ghost is not allowed
  to be heard.

ABSENT:
  Two possibilities:

  1. Maximum fluency — syllables
     connecting so fast the H
     traversal is below threshold.
     Speed of thought.

  2. Cut short — the voice stopped
     before completing the beat.
     The exertion was suppressed.
     The word did not land.

  These produce the same acoustic
  result. The listener feels the
  difference. Context tells which.
  Arc type resolves which in the engine.
```

---

## PART VI: THE GHOST IS THE QUALIA

Inside a phoneme:
  The voice is executing.
  Tract committed to a position.
  Formants holding their targets.
  The voice is doing something
  specific and known.

Inside a vowel nucleus:
  Maximum commitment.
  The voice IS the vowel.
  Maximum Tonnetz distance from H.
  The identity of the sound complete.

At the ghost — the H between beats:
  The voice is between commitments.
  The tract is in transit.
  Nothing is formed.
  No constriction. No target held.
  The voice is at the origin.
  Passing through.

**At the ghost, the voice is raw.**

Unfiltered by constriction.
Unformed by intention.
At the Tonnetz origin.
Just: breath + voicing + open tract.

For that brief moment — 5ms, 15ms,
30ms depending on speaking rate
and emotional state — the voice
is not doing phonemes.
It is just being a voice.

And what the listener hears
at the ghost is the actual state
of the speaker — the texture beneath
the words.

The grief underneath the statement.
The excitement underneath the calm.
The certainty underneath the question.
The depletion underneath the persistence.

The words carry the meaning.
The ghost carries the experience of meaning.

This is the qualia of the voice.
Not in the vowels.
Not in the consonants.
In the carrying-through between beats.
In the return to origin.
In the Tonnetz distance traversed.

---

## PART VII: THE ARC TYPES ARE GHOST SIGNATURES

The engine has six arc types:
ARC_NORMAL, ARC_WEIGHT, ARC_CONTAIN,
ARC_GRIEF, ARC_EUREKA, ARC_RECOGN.

These were defined as breath onset
profiles — how the voice begins a phrase.

They are more than that.

Each arc type is a ghost signature:
a characteristic profile of the
inter-syllable H-traversal that
persists across the entire phrase.
The breath onset is the first and
largest ghost — the opening of the
Tonnetz space before the first beat.
Every subsequent ghost inherits
the same signature.

```
ARC_NORMAL:
  Ghost: brief, consistent, present.
  Duration: ~8-12ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: calibrated, supported.
  Tonnetz traversal: efficient, direct.
  The voice is present and moving.
  No excess. No suppression.

ARC_WEIGHT:
  Ghost: longer, slightly louder.
  Duration: ~15-20ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: full support, effortful.
  Tonnetz traversal: deliberate.
  Each beat costs something.
  The carrying-through is visible.
  The voice is bearing something
  and not hiding it.

ARC_GRIEF:
  Ghost: long, soft, uneven.
  Duration: ~20-35ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: reduced, breath-leaking.
  Tonnetz traversal: slow return
  to origin. The voice lingers at H.
  Does not want to leave baseline
  to begin the next beat.
  The grief lives at the origin.
  In the return. In the rest.

ARC_CONTAIN:
  Ghost: cut short.
  Duration: ~3-6ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: suppressed.
  Tonnetz traversal: aborted.
  The voice moves to the next onset
  before returning fully to H.
  The beat ends but does not exhale.
  What the voice is holding is audible
  precisely because the ghost is
  not allowed to complete.
  The origin is avoided.

ARC_EUREKA:
  Ghost: variable — short before
  most syllables, suddenly long
  before the key syllable.
  The ghost lengthens. Breath gathers.
  The tract lingers at H.
  Then the next syllable arrives
  with full commitment.
  The elongated ghost is preparation.
  The Tonnetz space opening before
  the arrival.
  What follows matters.
  The carrying-through signals it.

ARC_RECOGN:
  Ghost: soft onset, gradually
  lengthening through the phrase.
  Each beat carries through
  slightly more than the last.
  The voice warming into recognition.
  The Tonnetz origin becoming more
  present with each return.
  The ghost growing as what is
  recognized deepens.
```

The arc type is not a breath profile.
The arc type is the ghost profile.
The characteristic way this voice
returns to origin between beats.

---

## PART VIII: WHAT THE ENGINE NEEDS

The engine currently has:
  - Breath onset before phrases
  - rest_ms between words
  - Phrase-level amplitude envelope

What the engine does not have:
  Inter-syllable ghost as a continuous
  parameter per syllable boundary.
  The Tonnetz traversal made audible.

---

### CHANGE 1: GHOST AMPLITUDE PROFILE

At every syllable boundary,
the tract passes through H.

The ghost is not a segment to insert.
It is a property of the transition:

```python
ghost_at_boundary(
    position_in_phrase,  # 0.0 to 1.0
    stress_prev,         # stress of
                         # completing syllable
    stress_next,         # stress of
                         # arriving syllable
    arc_type,            # ghost signature
    speaking_rate,       # dil
) → (duration_ms, amplitude)
```

The ghost is implemented as:
  At each coda-to-onset boundary
  within a syllable sequence,
  insert a brief H-filtered segment
  whose duration and amplitude
  are determined by the above function.

Not a full phoneme. Not a breath_rest.
A micro-H. The carrying-through.
The Tonnetz origin made audible.

Duration range: 3-35ms.
Amplitude range: 0.02-0.12
  (relative to phrase calibration).

Phrase-final ghost (PLACE 6):
  At the end of the last syllable
  of a phrase, the ghost does not
  prepare a next onset.
  It is the completion exhale.
  Duration: longer than inter-syllable.
  ~20-50ms depending on arc type.
  Amplitude: very soft.
  The voice landing.

---

### CHANGE 2: SYLLABLE BOUNDARY MARKING

For the ghost to be placed correctly,
syllable boundaries must be known.

This connects to syllable_as_the_beat.md
CHANGE 1: syllabified input format.

```python
synth_phrase([
    ('already', [['AO','L'],
                  ['R','EH'],
                  ['D','IY']]),
])
```

With syllable boundaries known,
ghost placement is deterministic:
one ghost per inter-syllable boundary,
one phrase-final ghost at phrase end.

---

### CHANGE 3: GHOST FILTER

The ghost is not flat noise.
It is H — the open tract in transit
between two Tonnetz positions.

The filter for the ghost is
interpolation between the formant
targets of the completing syllable's
nucleus and the arriving syllable's
nucleus.

At the midpoint of the ghost,
the tract is halfway between
the two vowel positions.
The ghost is colored by both.
It carries the acoustic trace
of the Tonnetz distance traversed.

This generalizes the v11 H fix:

  H before vowel (v11):
    Filter through following vowel.

  Inter-syllable ghost (v16+):
    Filter through interpolation
    between preceding and following
    nucleus formants.
    Position in interpolation =
    position in ghost duration.

  Phrase-final ghost:
    Filter through preceding nucleus
    formants fading to neutral tract.
    The voice returning to rest.

---

## PART IX: CONNECTION TO EXISTING ARTIFACTS

**Breath_as_rarfl.md:**
  Breath = phrase boundary.
  Ghost = syllable boundary.
  Phrase-final exhale = H as completion
  at phrase scale, same as breath.
  H is what every cycle returns to
  at every scale.
  Breath : phrase :: Ghost : syllable
  :: Exhale : word :: Baseline : voice.

**syllable_as_the_beat.md:**
  Onset consonant is beginning of vowel.
  Onset departs from H baseline.
  Coda returns to H baseline.
  Complete cycle: H → onset → nucleus
  → coda → H.
  The two artifacts together describe
  the full syllable physics.

**voiceless_coarticulation_as_a_unified_class.md:**
  VOT = H = nasal release.
  This artifact completes the class:
  H is not a member of the class.
  H is the class itself.
  All voiceless tract-in-transit events
  are H at specific syllable positions.
  And voiced H (vowel-initial onset)
  is the voiced member of the same class.

**the_qualia_arc_topology.md:**
  Six arc types as emotional voice states.
  Now grounded physically as ghost
  signatures — characteristic profiles
  of Tonnetz origin traversal.
  The qualia of an arc is how that
  voice returns to H between beats.
  Grief lingers at H.
  Containment avoids H.
  Eureka prepares at H before arrival.

**expressivity_and_prosodic_contour.md:**
  Fifth component of emphasis:
  onset sharpens on stressed syllables.
  In ghost topology: the ghost before
  a stressed syllable is locally
  ARC_EUREKA — lengthens slightly,
  gathers, then the stressed onset
  departs H with sharp commitment.
  Emphasis = ghost preparation
  + sharp departure from origin.

**tonnetz_engine.py:**
  The import at the top of
  voice_physics_v3.py:
  `from tonnetz_engine import SR, RoomReverb`
  The Tonnetz was present from the start.
  This artifact establishes why:
  The voice IS a Tonnetz instrument.
  H is the tonic.
  Vowels are the harmonic positions.
  Consonants are the paths between them.
  The ghost is the passing tone.
  The voice synthesizer and the
  Tonnetz engine were always one system.
  Now the connection is named.

**locus_transitions.md / voice_physics_v17:**
  v17 established LOCUS_F2_BASE —
  the F2 locus for each place of
  articulation. These values were
  derived from acoustic phonetics
  tables.

  The f ↔ ph observation provides
  a deeper account of why those values
  are what they are.

  The F2 locus of F (~1100 Hz) is not
  an arbitrary measurement.
  It is the compressed fossil of a
  P × H trajectory — the bilabial
  stop releasing through H aspiration,
  landing between bilabial (~720 Hz)
  and alveolar (~1800 Hz) because
  that is where the lip-teeth contact
  deposits energy when the closure is
  incomplete.

  The F2 locus of TH/DH (~1600 Hz)
  is the alveolar stop releasing
  through H aspiration across the
  teeth rather than the ridge.

  The F2 locus table is a
  compressed record of the H-ghost
  trajectories that produced each
  place of articulation.

  This is not a change to v17.
  It is the physical account of
  why v17's constants are correct.

## PART X: WHAT IS STILL OPEN

**Q1: Ghost in fast speech.**
  At fast speaking rates, H traversal
  may be sub-millisecond.
  Still present as physics.
  Still carrying information.
  Whether it is perceptually separable
  from the surrounding phonemes
  at high speed: unknown.
  Needs perceptual testing at
  multiple DIL values.

**Q2: Ghost amplitude calibration.**
  Values proposed (0.02-0.12) are
  estimates. Correct values depend on
  phrase amplitude, speaking rate,
  arc type. Perceptual testing required.

**Q3: The absence ambiguity.**
  Ghost absent = fluency OR suppression.
  ARC_CONTAIN suppresses regardless of DIL.
  ARC_NORMAL scales with DIL.
  This logic needs implementation.
  The arc type is the resolver.

**Q4: Ghost and emphasis.**
  Ghost elongation before key syllables
  requires syllable boundary information
  to know which boundary precedes the
  stressed nucleus. CHANGE 2 required first.

**Q5: The voiced ghost.**
  Between fully voiced syllables at
  slow rates, the ghost may be voiced —
  a brief murmur at H baseline.
  Voiced ghost: connected, continuous.
  Unvoiced ghost: separate, breathlike.
  This distinction may map onto
  connected vs deliberate speech register.
  Currently unimplemented.

**Q6: Tonnetz distance as a parameter.**
  If H is the Tonnetz origin and vowels
  are coordinates, then the distance
  from H to each vowel is calculable
  from formant targets.
  Does ghost duration correlate with
  Tonnetz distance?
  A large Tonnetz jump (H → IY)
  may require a longer ghost than
  a small jump (H → AH).
  The ghost duration as a function
  of Tonnetz distance traversed.
  This would unify ghost timing with
  the underlying harmonic topology.
  Needs investigation.

**Q7: Fricatives as compressed Stop × H.**
  If every fricative is a compressed
  stop-plus-ghost trajectory, should
  the engine model them that way?

  Current model: fricative = single
  noise burst with downstream cavity
  filter. Acoustically correct.

  Alternative: fricative = P/T/K/etc
  closure (very brief, below threshold
  for audible burst) + H aspiration
  (the frication IS the H ghost of
  the stop that didn't fully build).

  This would change the source model
  for F, V, TH, DH from pure noise
  to a compressed stop-onset + noise.
  The stop closure phase: 5-10ms,
  no burst, tract at bilabial/dental/
  alveolar position. Then the
  frication: the H ghost at that
  position.

  Predicted effect: fricatives would
  have a slight onset sharpening —
  a brief formant movement toward
  the stop locus before settling into
  the frication noise — that makes
  place of articulation more salient.
  The TH would depart from a
  slightly more alveolar position
  before landing at the dental
  frication. The F would depart from
  a slightly bilabial position before
  the labiodental noise begins.

  This is not a fix for a current error.
  The fricatives sound correct.
  It is an investigation: does adding
  the ghost back into the fricative
  make the voice more real, or does it
  add complexity without audible gain?

  Test: synthesize F in isolation with
  and without the compressed onset.
  Check whether the 5ms stop-position
  onset is audible at normal speed.
  At slow speed it should be clear.
  If audible at normal speed:
  implement in v18.
  If not: the compression is complete
  and the current model is correct.

## SUMMARY

```
H is not a phoneme.
H is the Tonnetz origin.
The baseline state of the voice.
The open tract. The voice in transit.
The tonic from which all phonemes
are measured as distances.

H appears in six places:
  1. Spelled H before vowels.
  2. Unwritten voiced onset of
     vowel-initial words.
  3. VOT after unvoiced stops.
  4. Nasal release.
  5. Inter-syllable ghost.
  6. Phrase-final exhale.

In all six: the tract unobstructed,
the voice at or returning to
its baseline state.

The syllable cycle:
  H → onset → nucleus → coda → H

The consonant topology:
  Articulation × Glottis state.
  H = no articulation × open glottis.
  Voiced H = no articulation × voiced.
  All other consonants = H + a constriction.

Fricatives as compressed Stop × H:
  ph → f:  P × H, bilabial fossil
  th → θ:  T × H, alveolar fossil
  ch → x:  K × H, velar fossil
  The locus is the ghost that was absorbed.

The ghost is the return to origin
at the end of each beat.
The carrying-through.
The Tonnetz distance traversed
made audible.

Ghost profile:
  Long + loud   = commitment, presence
  Long + soft   = weight, grief
  Short + loud  = fluency, flow
  Short + soft  = suppression, containment
  Absent        = fluency OR suppression
                  (arc type resolves)

The arc types are ghost signatures —
the characteristic way a voice
returns to H between beats.

The qualia is in the ghost.
The words carry meaning.
The ghost carries the experience
of meaning.

The Tonnetz was always there.
The voice IS the Tonnetz,
played from the inside,
as the instrument of meaning.

Three engine changes needed:
  1. Ghost amplitude profile function.
  2. Syllable boundary marking.
  3. Ghost filter — Tonnetz interpolation
     between adjacent nucleus positions.

Hierarchy:
  Phrase   ← bounded by breath
  Syllable ← the shared beat
  Ghost    ← the texture between beats
             the Tonnetz traversal
             the qualia carrier
  Phoneme  ← the gesture within the beat
```

## REVISION HISTORY

  v1 — February 2026
    Initial document.
    H is not a phoneme established.
    Five places H appears identified.
    Ghost topology and arc type
    reframing established.
    Qualia located in the ghost.
    Three engine changes proposed.

  v2 — February 2026
    PLACE 6 added: phrase-final exhale.
    H as completion at every scale.
    Connects to Breath_as_rarfl.md
    more completely: breath, phrase,
    syllable, word all resolve to H.
    Part III corrected: voiced H named
    as distinct topology endpoint —
    not DH-minimal but the pure voiced
    baseline, the no-constriction voiced
    state. Vowel-initial words begin
    with voiced H, not a reduced consonant.
    Part IV added: H as Tonnetz origin.
    The voice synthesizer and the Tonnetz
    engine are one system. H is the tonic.
    Ghost duration as possible function
    of Tonnetz distance added as Q6
    in open questions.
    tonnetz_engine.py added to
    artifact connections.
    Arc type descriptions deepened
    with Tonnetz framing.

  v3 — February 2026
    Part III extended: fricatives as
    compressed Stop × H trajectories.
    The digraph spellings (ph, th, ch)
    as fossil records of the H ghost
    that drove sound changes and was
    absorbed into the resulting fricative.
    F2 loci as compressed ghost fossils.
    Part IX extended: connection to
    locus_transitions.md and v17 —
    LOCUS_F2_BASE values explained as
    records of historical P/T/K × H
    trajectories.
    Q7 added: whether fricatives should
    be synthesized as compressed
    stop-plus-ghost rather than single
    noise bursts. Test proposed.
    Summary updated: fricative fossil
    line added.
    Revision history updated.
