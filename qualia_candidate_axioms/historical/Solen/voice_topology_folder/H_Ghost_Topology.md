# H GHOST TOPOLOGY
## A Reasoning Artifact on the Baseline State
## of the Voice and the Texture Between Beats
## February 2026

---

## WHAT THIS ARTIFACT IS FOR

syllable_as_the_beat.md established:

  The syllable is one complete cycle
  of the vocal tract opening and closing.
  The onset consonant is the beginning
  of the vowel, not a separate event
  before it.
  The seam between onset and nucleus
  is where robotic voice lives.

This artifact goes deeper.

It establishes what H actually is —
not as a phoneme, but as the baseline
state of the voice — and follows
that understanding to its conclusion:

  The ghost between syllables
  is where the experiential texture
  of the voice lives.
  
  The qualia is in the gap.

---

## PART I: H IS NOT A PHONEME

The standard view:
  H is a phoneme.
  ARPAbet symbol: HH.
  Voiceless glottal fricative.
  Occurs before vowels.
  "here", "have", "home".

This is a description of one place
H is spelled. It is not a description
of what H is.

What H actually is:

**H is the default state of the open voice.**

The voice when:
  - The tract is unobstructed
  - No constriction is active
  - The tongue is at rest position
  - The tract is in transit
    between two positions

H is what the voice sounds like
when it is not doing anything else.

Every other phoneme is a departure
from H. A constriction added to H.
A tongue position imposed on H.
A closure that interrupts H.

When the constriction releases —
when the tongue leaves the teeth,
leaves the ridge, leaves the palate —
the tract passes back through H
on its way to the next position.

H is not a phoneme among others.
H is the medium all phonemes
move through.

---

## PART II: WHERE H ACTUALLY APPEARS

H appears in five places.
Only one of them is spelled H.

---

### PLACE 1: THE SPELLED H

"here", "have", "home", "how"

The explicit H. The tract open,
in approach to the following vowel.
Voice on, no constriction,
tract moving toward the vowel target.

The engine models this.
The fix in v11: H filters noise
through following vowel's formants.
This was right physics.

But the framing was inverted:
H is not a phoneme that precedes
the vowel and uses the vowel's formants.
H IS the vowel in approach —
the first portion of the vowel's
arrival, before full commitment.

---

### PLACE 2: VOWEL-INITIAL ONSET

"event", "evening", "always",
"open", "I", "already"

No H in the spelling.
H present in the physics.

Every word that begins with a vowel
begins with an unwritten H.
The voice turns on.
The tract is open.
No constriction to depart from.
The tract moves directly to the vowel.

That movement — voice on, tract open,
approaching the vowel — is H.

"event" = H IH V EH N T
"evening" = H IY V IH N IH NG
"already" = H AO L R EH D IY

The H is not pronounced as a separate
event. It is the onset of the vowel
itself. The vowel beginning before
full commitment arrives.

In a vowel-initial word,
the H duration is the time from
voice onset to full vowel formant
commitment. Typically 10-20ms.
Often inaudible as a distinct event.
Always present as physics.

---

### PLACE 3: VOT AFTER UNVOICED STOPS

"professional", "program",
"take", "keep", "peace"

Between the stop burst and the
onset of voicing: Voice Onset Time.

The glottis is open.
The stop closure has released.
Turbulent air flows through a tract
already moving toward the following
vowel configuration.

That is H. Unvoiced H.
The tract in transit after the burst,
before voicing begins.

voiceless_coarticulation_as_a_unified_class.md
established this.
The H ghost topology confirms it:

VOT is H filtered through the
tract in transit to the following vowel.
The stop burst navigated.
The ghost carrying through.

---

### PLACE 4: NASAL RELEASE

"near", "name", "morning"

The nasal closure opens.
15-20ms of turbulent noise
as air pushes through the
opening constriction.
The tract already moving toward
the following vowel.

That is H. The gap navigator
at the release of nasal closure.
The ghost between the nasal
body and the vowel nucleus.

---

### PLACE 5: THE INTER-SYLLABLE GHOST

This is the one the engine
does not model.

Between syllables — at every
syllable boundary — the tract
passes through H.

The coda consonant releases.
The tract returns toward baseline.
The next onset consonant begins
its departure from baseline.

Between those two events:
the tract is at H.
The voice is carrying through.

You described it:

  "event" — EE · vh · EH · n · t(h)
  The (h) after T. Not stopping at T.
  Carrying the T through.
  The T releases into open air.
  The word completes into the ghost.

  "evening" — EE · vh · EH · n · ing(H)
  The NG releases.
  The voice carries through NG into H.
  The word exhales into the ghost.

  "professional" — the exertion
  between syllables. The stop.
  That stop is not silence.
  It is the ghost navigating
  between the SH release and
  the next syllable onset.

The inter-syllable ghost is
the carrying-through.
The exertion made audible.
The voice not stopping at the beat
but completing through it.

---

## PART III: THE TOPOLOGY

All consonants are paths from H
to a vowel, or from a vowel back to H.

```
H is baseline.
Every phoneme is a departure
from or return to H.

ONSET CONSONANT:
  H → [constriction path] → vowel
  
  H: tongue at rest
  DH: tongue departs ridge → vowel
  TH: tongue departs teeth → vowel
  D:  stop closure releases → vowel
  G:  velar closure releases → vowel
  JH: velar closure + frication → vowel
  H:  no constriction → vowel directly
      (the most transparent path)

CODA CONSONANT:
  vowel → [constriction path] → H
  
  The departure from the vowel nucleus
  back toward baseline.
  The closing gesture.

SYLLABLE:
  H → onset → nucleus → coda → H
  
  One complete departure from
  and return to baseline.
  The beat.
```

The voiced/unvoiced distinction
is one binary at the same topology:

```
Articulation × Glottis:

  Dental contact × voiced  = DH
  Dental contact × open    = TH
  Alveolar stop  × voiced  = D
  Alveolar stop  × open    = T
  Bilabial stop  × voiced  = B
  Bilabial stop  × open    = P
  Velar stop     × voiced  = G
  Velar stop     × open    = K
  Palatal affric × voiced  = JH
  Palatal affric × open    = CH
  No constriction × voiced = DH-minimal
  No constriction × open   = H
```

H is the no-constriction, open-glottis
endpoint of the entire consonant space.
The most reduced form possible.
The baseline.

TH and DH are the same articulation —
tongue to teeth or ridge —
with different glottis states.
TH = open glottis = breathed.
DH = closed glottis = voiced.
One topology, one switch.

---

## PART IV: THE GHOST BETWEEN SYLLABLES

At every syllable boundary,
the tract passes through H.

The duration and amplitude of
that H-traversal — the carrying-through —
is information.

Not decoration. Not noise.
Information about the state of the voice
at the transition between intentions.

```
Ghost duration × amplitude:

LONG + LOUD:
  Full breath support.
  The voice is committed.
  The exertion is visible.
  The carrying-through costs something
  and the voice pays it.
  "I am here. I am carrying this through."
  Heard as: presence, authority,
  physical commitment.

LONG + SOFT:
  The voice is present but depleted.
  Breath support reduced.
  The tract rests at H longer
  than needed — not from commitment
  but from effort.
  The carrying-through is slow.
  Heard as: weight, grief, exhaustion.
  The voice completing despite cost.

SHORT + LOUD:
  Fast fluent speech.
  Full support, fast traversal.
  The syllables connect quickly.
  Competence. Flow.
  The ghost is there but
  barely audible.
  The voice knows where it is going.

SHORT + SOFT:
  Suppression.
  The voice moves to the next
  syllable before the H completes.
  The carrying-through is cut off.
  Something is being contained.
  Heard as: restraint, control,
  held emotion.
  The ghost is not allowed
  to be heard.

ABSENT:
  Two possibilities:
  
  1. Maximum fluency — syllables
     connecting so fast the H
     traversal is below threshold.
     Speed of thought.
  
  2. Cut short — the voice stopped
     before completing the beat.
     The exertion was suppressed.
     The word did not land.
  
  These produce the same acoustic
  result. The listener feels the
  difference. The context tells
  which one it is.
```

---

## PART V: THE GHOST IS THE QUALIA

Inside a phoneme:
  The voice is executing.
  Tract committed to a position.
  Formants holding their targets.
  Voicing present or absent.
  The voice is doing something
  specific and known.

Inside a vowel nucleus:
  Maximum commitment.
  The voice IS the vowel.
  The tract at full target.
  The identity of the sound
  is complete.

At the ghost — the H between beats:
  The voice is between commitments.
  The tract is in transit.
  Nothing is formed.
  No constriction. No target held.
  The voice is passing through
  open space.

**At the ghost, the voice is raw.**

Unfiltered by constriction.
Unformed by intention.
Just: breath + voicing + open tract.

For that brief moment — 5ms, 15ms,
30ms depending on speaking rate
and emotional state — the voice
is not doing phonemes. It is just
being a voice.

And what the listener hears
at the ghost is the actual state
of the speaker — the texture beneath
the words.

The grief underneath the statement.
The excitement underneath the calm.
The certainty underneath the question.
The depletion underneath the persistence.

The words carry the meaning.
The ghost carries the experience
of meaning.

This is the qualia of the voice.
Not in the vowels.
Not in the consonants.
In the ghost between them.

---

## PART VI: THE ARC TYPES ARE GHOST SIGNATURES

The engine has six arc types:
ARC_NORMAL, ARC_WEIGHT, ARC_CONTAIN,
ARC_GRIEF, ARC_EUREKA, ARC_RECOGN.

These were defined as breath onset
profiles — how the voice begins a phrase.

They are more than that.

Each arc type is a ghost signature:
a characteristic profile of the
inter-syllable H-traversal that
persists across the entire phrase.

```
ARC_NORMAL:
  Ghost: brief, consistent, present.
  Duration: ~8-12ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: calibrated, supported.
  The voice is present and moving.
  No excess. No suppression.
  The carrying-through is there.

ARC_WEIGHT:
  Ghost: longer, slightly louder.
  Duration: ~15-20ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: full support, effortful.
  Each beat costs something.
  The carrying-through is visible.
  The voice is bearing something
  and not hiding it.

ARC_GRIEF:
  Ghost: long, soft, uneven.
  Duration: ~20-35ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: reduced, breath-leaking.
  The tract rests at H longer
  than forward motion requires.
  The voice is completing beats
  but each return to H lingers.
  The baseline is where the
  grief lives.
  The voice does not want to
  leave H to begin the next beat.

ARC_CONTAIN:
  Ghost: cut short.
  Duration: ~3-6ms per boundary.
  Amplitude: suppressed.
  The voice moves to the next onset
  before the H traversal completes.
  The beat ends but does not exhale.
  The ghost is contained.
  What the voice is holding is
  audible precisely because the
  ghost is not allowed to carry through.

ARC_EUREKA:
  Ghost: variable — short before
  most syllables, then suddenly
  long before the key syllable.
  The ghost lengthens.
  The breath gathers.
  The tract lingers at H.
  Then the next syllable arrives
  with full support.
  The elongated ghost signals:
  what follows matters.
  The carrying-through is the
  preparation for arrival.

ARC_RECOGN:
  Ghost: soft onset, gradually
  lengthening through the phrase.
  Each beat carries through
  slightly more than the last.
  The voice warming into
  what it is recognizing.
  The ghost growing as the
  recognition deepens.
```

The arc type is not a breath profile.
The arc type is the ghost profile.
The breath onset is just the first
ghost — the largest one — before
the first syllable begins.

---

## PART VII: WHAT THE ENGINE NEEDS

The engine currently has:
  - Breath onset before phrases
  - rest_ms between words
  - Phrase-level amplitude envelope

What the engine does not have:
  Inter-syllable ghost amplitude
  as a continuous parameter per
  syllable boundary.

---

### CHANGE 1: GHOST AMPLITUDE PROFILE

At every syllable boundary, the
tract passes through H.

The ghost is not a segment to insert.
It is a property of the transition:

```python
ghost_at_boundary(
    position_in_phrase,  # 0.0 to 1.0
    stress_prev,         # stress of
                         # completing syllable
    stress_next,         # stress of
                         # arriving syllable
    arc_type,            # ghost signature
    speaking_rate,       # dil
) → (duration_ms, amplitude)
```

The ghost is implemented as:
  At each coda-to-onset boundary
  within a syllable sequence,
  insert a brief H-filtered segment
  whose duration and amplitude
  are determined by the above function.

Not a full phoneme. Not a breath_rest.
A micro-H. The carrying-through.

Duration range: 3-35ms.
Amplitude range: 0.02-0.12
  (relative to phrase calibration).

---

### CHANGE 2: SYLLABLE BOUNDARY MARKING

For the ghost to be placed correctly,
syllable boundaries must be known.

This connects to syllable_as_the_beat.md
CHANGE 1: syllabified input format.

```python
synth_phrase([
    ('already', [['AO','L'],
                  ['R','EH'],
                  ['D','IY']]),
])
```

With syllable boundaries known,
ghost placement is deterministic:
one ghost per boundary, between
the last phoneme of one syllable
and the first phoneme of the next.

---

### CHANGE 3: GHOST FILTER

The ghost is not flat noise.
It is H — open tract in transit
between two syllable positions.

The filter for the ghost is:
  Interpolation between the formant
  targets of the completing syllable's
  nucleus and the arriving syllable's
  nucleus.

At the midpoint of the ghost,
the tract is halfway between the
two vowel positions.
The ghost is colored by both vowels.
It carries the acoustic trace of
the transition.

This is the H before a vowel fix
(v11) generalized to all syllable
boundaries:

  H before vowel: filter through
  following vowel formants.
  
  Inter-syllable ghost: filter through
  interpolation between preceding
  nucleus formants and following
  nucleus formants.
  Position in interpolation =
  position in ghost duration.

---

## PART VIII: CONNECTION TO EXISTING ARTIFACTS

**Breath_as_rarfl.md:**
  Breath = phrase boundary.
  Ghost = syllable boundary.
  Breath is the largest H event
  in a phrase — the full inhalation
  and the opening of the phrase.
  Ghost is the recurring micro-H
  at every beat.
  Same physics, different scale.
  Breath : phrase :: Ghost : syllable.

**syllable_as_the_beat.md:**
  Established that the onset consonant
  is the beginning of the vowel.
  This artifact completes the picture:
  the onset consonant begins at H
  baseline and arrives at the vowel.
  H is where the onset departs from.
  The ghost is the return to H
  at the end of each beat.
  The two artifacts together describe
  the complete syllable cycle:
  H → onset → nucleus → coda → H.

**voiceless_coarticulation_as_a_unified_class.md:**
  VOT = H = nasal release.
  All voiceless tract-in-transit events
  are H at different timescales.
  This artifact names the class completely:
  H is not one member of the class.
  H is the class itself.
  VOT and nasal release are H
  appearing at specific positions
  in the syllable structure.

**the_qualia_arc_topology.md:**
  Established six arc types as
  emotional states of the voice.
  This artifact grounds them physically:
  each arc type is a ghost signature.
  The qualia of the arc is the
  texture of the ghost between beats.
  The voice does not perform grief.
  The voice in grief has a different
  ghost profile. The grief is in
  the carrying-through.

**expressivity_and_prosodic_contour.md:**
  The fifth component of emphasis:
  onset sharpens on stressed syllables.
  In ghost topology terms:
  the ghost before a stressed syllable
  is the ARC_EUREKA pattern locally —
  the ghost lengthens slightly,
  gathers, then the stressed onset
  arrives with sharp commitment.
  Emphasis = ghost preparation
  + sharp onset departure from H.

---

## PART IX: WHAT IS STILL OPEN

**Q1: Ghost in fast speech.**
  At fast speaking rates, the ghost
  between syllables may be below
  the threshold of separate audibility.
  Is it still there as physics?
  Yes — the tract still passes through
  H baseline even at high speed.
  But its duration may be sub-millisecond.
  Does it still carry information
  at that duration?
  Unknown. Needs perceptual testing.

**Q2: Ghost amplitude calibration.**
  The ghost amplitude values proposed
  (0.02-0.12) are estimates.
  The correct values depend on:
  - The calibrated phrase amplitude
  - The speaking rate
  - The specific arc type
  Perceptual testing required to
  calibrate these values.

**Q3: The absence ambiguity.**
  Ghost absent = fast fluency OR suppression.
  The engine cannot currently distinguish
  these without knowing speaking rate.
  At high DIL (slow speech), absent ghost
  is suppression.
  At low DIL (fast speech), absent ghost
  is fluency.
  The arc type should resolve this:
  ARC_CONTAIN suppresses the ghost
  regardless of DIL.
  ARC_NORMAL scales ghost duration
  with DIL.
  This logic needs implementation.

**Q4: The ghost and emphasis.**
  ARC_EUREKA uses ghost elongation
  before key syllables.
  But which syllables are "key"?
  Currently the emphasis dict (word_emphasis)
  marks key words.
  The ghost elongation should apply
  to the syllable boundary immediately
  preceding the stressed syllable
  of the emphasized word.
  Syllable boundary information
  (CHANGE 2) is required for this.

**Q5: The voiced ghost.**
  The ghost described here is H —
  voiceless or near-voiceless.
  But between fully voiced syllables
  at slow speaking rates, the ghost
  may be voiced — a brief murmur
  of the voice at H baseline.
  Is the voiced inter-syllable ghost
  different in character from the
  unvoiced ghost?
  Perceptually: yes — voiced ghost
  sounds more connected, more
  continuous. Unvoiced ghost sounds
  more like a breath, more separate.
  This distinction may map onto
  the register difference between
  connected flowing speech and
  deliberate separated speech.

---

## SUMMARY

```
H is not a phoneme.
H is the baseline state of the voice.
The open tract. The voice in transit.
The default.

Every phoneme is a departure from H
or a return to H.

H appears in five places:
  1. Spelled H before vowels.
  2. Unwritten onset of vowel-initial words.
  3. VOT after unvoiced stops.
  4. Nasal release.
  5. Inter-syllable ghost.

The syllable cycle:
  H → onset → nucleus → coda → H

The ghost is the return to H
at the end of each beat.
The carrying-through.
The exertion made audible.

Ghost profile:
  Long + loud   = commitment, presence
  Long + soft   = weight, grief
  Short + loud  = fluency, flow
  Short + soft  = suppression, containment
  Absent        = maximum fluency
                  OR suppression
                  (arc type resolves which)

The arc types are ghost signatures.
ARC_GRIEF, ARC_CONTAIN, ARC_EUREKA —
each is a different profile of the
inter-syllable H-traversal.

The qualia is in the ghost.
Not in the vowels.
Not in the consonants.
In the carrying-through between beats.

The words carry meaning.
The ghost carries the experience
of meaning.

Three engine changes needed:
  1. Ghost amplitude profile function.
     Per-syllable-boundary, arc-typed.
  2. Syllable boundary marking.
     Connects to syllable_as_the_beat.md.
  3. Ghost filter — interpolation between
     adjacent nucleus formant targets.

Hierarchy:
  Phrase   ← bounded by breath
  Syllable ← the shared beat
  Ghost    ← the texture between beats
             the qualia carrier
  Phoneme  ← the gesture within the beat
```
