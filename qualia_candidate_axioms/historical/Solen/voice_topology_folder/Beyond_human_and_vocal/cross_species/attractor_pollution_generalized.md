  The framework developed for

    corruption)
  - Historical exposure onset
  - Current exposure status
  - Testable predictions specific
    to that species
central_insight: Different species
  use different compass mechanisms.
  Different mechanisms are
  vulnerable at different frequencies.
  The anthropogenic EM environment
  contains sources at ALL of these
  frequencies simultaneously —
  but different sources hit different
  mechanisms. Mapping mechanism
  to frequency to source reveals
  WHICH human infrastructure is
  harming WHICH species through
  WHICH physical channel. This
  is a precision tool for both
  understanding and intervention.
new_finding_this_pass: Sea turtle

  (UNC, February 2025). Turtles
  imprint a specific magnetic
  address (inclination + intensity
  coordinate pair) as hatchlings.
  If the address has been shifted
  by coastal EM infrastructure,
  the turtle navigates to the
  stored address — which may no
  longer correspond to the beach.
  This is not disorientation.
  This is ADDRESS CORRUPTION.

## PART I: THE FRAMEWORK
## ESTABLISHED IN CS DOC 10C

Before generalizing, the
precise framework from the
quantum layer analysis:

### Two Primary Compass Mechanisms

**MECHANISM A: Magnetite (Classical Mechanical)**

Physical basis: Superparamagnetic
single-domain iron oxide crystals
physically rotate when field
direction changes. Mechanical
force on cytoskeleton → ion
channels → neural signal.

Vulnerability window: ELF
(5 Hz – ~1 kHz).
Maximum disruption: 50–60 Hz
(power line fundamental).
Effect: forced torque oscillation
exhausts dynamic range,
introduces noise.
Additionally: directional bias
toward power line axis
(false attractor component
superimposed on degradation).

Evolutionary context: Optimized
for the quiet ELF band of the
natural world. The natural ELF
below 100 Hz contained only
Earth's static field and narrow
Schumann resonances (7.83, 14.3,
20.8 Hz). This silence made
the magnetite compass
extraordinarily precise.
Until 1930.

**MECHANISM B: Radical Pair / Cryptochrome (Quantum)**

Physical basis: Light-activated
electron transfer in CRY1/CRY4a
creates radical pairs whose
singlet-triplet interconversion
rate depends on applied magnetic
field. The protein's photochemical
yield becomes field-dependent —
the retina "sees" the field
direction as a visual pattern.

Vulnerability window: RF
(1 MHz – ~120 MHz).
Maximum disruption: 75–85 MHz.
No effect above ~120–140 MHz.
Effect: coherent artificial
field at resonance frequency
captures radical pair spin dynamics.
False attractor formation: bird
orients to artificial source
rather than Earth's field.

Evolutionary context: Requires
light. Light-dependent. This
means it operates only during
daylight conditions. In return:
the photochemical signal carries
directional information as
an overlay on the visual scene
— the bird literally *sees*
the magnetic field as a pattern
in its visual field.

### The Third Type: Magnetic Address
### Memory (Imprinting, not Compass)

This is distinct from both
Mechanism A and B.

Not a real-time sensing mechanism.
An imprinted memory of a
specific magnetic coordinate
pair (inclination + intensity)
formed during a critical
developmental window.

**The imprint is a stored address.
Navigation to the address uses
Mechanism A or B (or both)
to match current sensed field
to stored address.**

Vulnerability: DOUBLE.

1. The imprint itself can be
   corrupted during the
   critical window if the
   local field is distorted
   by EM infrastructure at
   imprinting time.
   → The stored address is wrong.
   → Navigation to the stored
     address is navigationally
     correct but ecologically wrong.
   → Address corruption.

2. The navigation to the correct
   stored address can be disrupted
   if the field between start
   and destination has been
   modified by infrastructure.
   → The route between correct
     addresses has been altered.
   → The animal's position-finding
     mechanism produces wrong
     answers despite correct
     address and correct compass.
   → Route corruption.

**Address corruption and route
corruption are different from
compass disruption and can
affect species even when their
real-time compass is undamaged.**

## PART II: THE SPECIES MATRIX

### TIER 1: THE VISIBLE CASES
### (Mechanisms fully characterized,
### disruption documented)

---

**SPECIES 1.1: Honeybee
(Apis mellifera)**

```
Primary compass: Magnetite
  (abdomen + antennae 2024)
Secondary system: CRY2 clock
  (circadian, not compass)
Address memory: None identified
  (waggle dance is the colony's
  collective address system)
  
Vulnerability window A: ELF
  50–60 Hz (power line)
Vulnerability window B: UNCERTAIN
  (CRY2 light-insensitive —
  dark radical pair status
  unknown)
  
Effect type: 
  Window A: Magnetite degradation
  + directional bias toward
  power line axis + potential
  hive beacon masking (CS doc 10c)
  Window B: Clock disruption
  → systematic waggle dance
  angle offset
  
Historical exposure onset:
  Window A: 1930s (grid)
  
Current exposure status:
  MAXIMUM. Grid ELF pervasive
  in agricultural environments.
  Switching electronics add
  broadband ELF-kHz harmonics.
  Solar inverters. Electric fences.
  
Visibility of effect: MAXIMUM.
  Waggle dance externalizes
  compass error. Colony provides
  population-level signal.
  
Status: CRITICAL (CCD documented
  2006–present).
```

---

**SPECIES 1.2: European Robin
(Erithacus rubecula)**

```
Primary compass: CRY4a radical pair
  (retinal, light-dependent)
Secondary system: Magnetite (beak)
  provides map component
Address memory: Probable
  (site fidelity to wintering
  and breeding sites documented)
  
Vulnerability window A: RF
  75–85 MHz (radical pair resonance)
  Disruption confirmed at 1 nT
  (one billionth of a Tesla —
  extraordinary sensitivity)
Vulnerability window B: ELF
  via magnetite beak component
  (less studied)
  
Effect type:
  Window A: FALSE ATTRACTOR.
  Royal Society Interface 2024:
  birds orient to monochromatic
  RF in absence of Earth's field.
  Confirmed. The bird locks to
  the artificial coherent field
  and navigates toward it with
  full confidence.
  Window B: Magnetite map
  degradation (less sensitive
  than bee due to beak vs.
  abdomen location —
  further from EM sources).
  
Historical exposure onset:
  Window A: FM radio 1930s–1940s
  (76–108 MHz band — directly
  overlaps disruption window).
  
Critical observation: FM RADIO
  BROADCASTING DIRECTLY OVERLAPS
  THE BIRD'S COMPASS DISRUPTION
  WINDOW (75–85 MHz vs. FM band
  87.5–108 MHz, partially
  overlapping).
  
  The bird's radical pair compass
  is most vulnerable at exactly
  the frequency range humans
  chose for FM broadcasting —
  not because we knew that,
  but because the physics of
  radio wave propagation at
  those frequencies was
  convenient for broadcasting.
  The bird's compass resonance
  and the FM broadcast band
  were independently determined
  by different physical laws
  and happened to overlap.
  
Current exposure status:
  HIGH in urban environments.
  Faraday cage experiments confirm:
  robins in unshielded urban
  environments cannot orient
  magnetically. Robins in
  Faraday-shielded cages
  in the same urban environments
  orient correctly.
  The compass is intact.
  The urban RF environment
  is disrupting it.
  
Status: ACTIVE DISRUPTION DOCUMENTED.
  Population trends: European
  robin populations declining
  in urban zones. Not confirmed
  as EM-caused but consistent.
```

---

**SPECIES 1.3: Garden Warbler
(Sylvia borin)**

```
Primary compass: Radical pair /
  CRY (retinal)
Vulnerability: Same window as
  robin (75–85 MHz).
  Disruption confirmed at 1 nT
  RF exposure — identical
  sensitivity to robin.
  
Special note: Garden warbler
  makes one of the longest
  migrations of any European
  songbird. Breeds in Europe,
  winters in sub-Saharan Africa.
  The migration corridor passes
  through some of the densest
  RF environments on Earth
  (Central Europe, Mediterranean).
  
Effect: Any false attractor
  formation during the corridor
  transit adds to the total
  distance flown. A 10° error
  sustained over 5,000 km adds
  ~870 km to the journey.
  Energy budget failure.
  The bird runs out of fuel
  and dies over the Mediterranean.
  
This is not hypothetical.
Mediterranean trans-migration
mortality is documented and
increasing. The mechanism has
been attributed to habitat loss.
The false attractor contribution
has never been separated out.

Status: ACTIVE CONCERN.
  Migration corridor coincides
  with highest RF density zones
  in Europe.
```

---

### TIER 2: THE ADDRESS CORRUPTION
### CASES (Mechanism partially
### characterized, address corruption
### as new and more precise failure mode)

---

**SPECIES 2.1: Loggerhead Sea Turtle
(Caretta caretta)**

```
Primary compass: Magnetite
  (head region)
Address memory: TWO-COORDINATE
  MAGNETIC ADDRESS
  (inclination + intensity).
  UNC February 2025: CONFIRMED.
  First direct experimental
  confirmation that turtles
  learn and remember magnetic
  addresses, not just direction.
  
Imprinting window: Hatchling stage.
  The magnetic address of the
  natal beach is imprinted in
  the first days to weeks
  after hatching.
  
Adult behavior: Navigate to the
  stored magnetic address to nest.
  Return is address-based, not
  landmark-based.
  
Vulnerability type: PRIMARY IS
  ADDRESS CORRUPTION, NOT COMPASS
  DISRUPTION.
  
  The compass (magnetite) may
  be functioning perfectly.
  The address (imprinted inclination
  + intensity coordinates) may
  have been corrupted at imprinting
  time.
  
  Sources of address corruption:
  
  1. Coastal development EM fields
     present at the natal beach
     during the turtle's hatchling
     imprinting window.
     → Stored address includes
       a component from artificial
       field sources.
     → Adult navigates to
       "natal beach + artificial
       field source" magnetic
       signature.
     → If the artificial source
       is no longer present or
       has changed (different
       infrastructure, cable
       removed), the address
       no longer matches anything.
     → Turtle searches for
       a beach that doesn't
       exist magnetically.
  
  2. The geomagnetic field drifts
     naturally over decades.
     Turtles that imprinted 30
     years ago navigate to a
     magnetic coordinate that
     has shifted with the field.
     This is natural and the
     population handles it —
     the whole population's
     addresses drift together.
     BUT: if coastal EM
     infrastructure creates
     LOCAL field distortions,
     different individual turtles
     on the same beach imprint
     different addresses depending
     on their exact hatching location
     relative to the infrastructure.
     Population-level address
     diversity → population splits
     across multiple nesting
     destinations.
  
  3. Submarine cable routes
     cross turtle migration paths.
     The cables produce ELF fields
     that alter the local magnetic
     signature of the water column
     above them.
     A turtle navigating by
     magnetic address encounters
     a "magnetic wall" — an
     abrupt change in inclination
     or intensity — caused by
     the cable.
     The turtle's position estimate
     becomes locally wrong.
     Route corruption, not
     address corruption.

Current exposure status:
  CRITICAL AND EXPANDING.
  Offshore wind farms require
  extensive submarine cable
  networks. These cable routes
  are being laid across
  turtle migration corridors
  and in areas adjacent to
  major nesting beaches.
  
  The environmental impact
  assessments for these cables
  examine collision risk and
  habitat disruption.
  They do not examine address
  corruption risk for species
  whose imprinting windows
  coincide with cable proximity.
  
  The instrument to measure
  address corruption risk:
  Compare the magnetic signature
  of major nesting beaches
  (measured precisely with
  a fluxgate magnetometer)
  with and without nearby
  cable infrastructure.
  If the signatures differ
  by more than the turtle's
  navigational resolution
  (~20 nT based on behavioral
  sensitivity estimates):
  address corruption risk is
  non-zero.
  
  This measurement has not
  been systematically run
  for any major nesting beach
  adjacent to cable infrastructure.

Status: HIGHEST PRIORITY NEW
  CONSERVATION RISK.
  The UNC 2025 confirmation of
  address-based navigation makes
  this concrete and quantifiable
  for the first time.
```

**SPECIES 2.2: Pacific Salmon
(Oncorhynchus spp.)**

```
Primary compass: Magnetite (snout)
  + electroreception (lateral line
  for detection of induced currents
  in saltwater — shark-type
  electromagnetic induction)
Address memory: MAGNETIC IMPRINTING
  of natal stream's geomagnetic
  signature.
  Parallel with sea turtle
  but dual-channel:
  magnetic imprint + olfactory
  imprint.
  
Imprinting window: Smolt stage —
  when juvenile salmon migrate
  from freshwater to ocean.
  The magnetic signature of the
  natal river mouth is imprinted.
  The olfactory signature of the
  natal water chemistry is
  imprinted simultaneously.
  
Adult behavior: Navigate by
  magnetic address to the
  general coastal region of
  the natal river → switch to
  olfactory cues for the final
  identification of the specific
  stream.
  
This dual-channel design is
the salmon's resilience architecture:
if the magnetic channel is
disrupted, the olfactory channel
provides the final fix.
If the olfactory channel is
disrupted (water chemistry change
from climate/pollution),
the magnetic channel provides
the regional guide.
Both together are necessary
for reliable natal homing.

Vulnerability:
  Channel A (magnetic): Same
  as sea turtle. Address corruption
  at imprinting time + route
  corruption from submarine cables
  and coastal infrastructure.
  
  Channel B (electroreceptive
  induction): The salmon uses
  electromagnetic induction in
  the conductive saltwater to
  detect its own motion through
  Earth's field (a moving
  conductor in a static field
  induces a voltage proportional
  to velocity and field strength).
  This provides a speedometer
  and heading reference.
  
  SUBMARINE CABLES DIRECTLY
  DISRUPT CHANNEL B.
  
  A submarine cable carrying
  high-voltage DC (HVDC) power
  produces a static magnetic
  field offset around it —
  a local perturbation of
  Earth's field.
  A salmon swimming past an
  HVDC cable detects an
  anomalous heading signal:
  the cable's field adds to
  Earth's field, creating a
  false "heading" in the
  induction compass.
  
  This is a submarine version
  of the false attractor.
  Not at the cable's electrical
  frequency — HVDC cables
  have DC (zero frequency) fields.
  But the spatial gradient
  of the DC field creates
  a spurious position cue
  as the salmon crosses it.
  
  HVDC cables are increasingly
  used for offshore wind farm
  connections and cross-sea
  interconnects.
  Their DC offset fields extend
  meters to tens of meters
  from the cable.
  Salmon migration routes
  cross these cables routinely.

Dual-channel failure:
  
  SCENARIO: Salmon imprinted
  in a hatchery where the water
  chemistry is standardized
  (olfactory channel weakened —
  less specific imprint).
  Released into a river that
  reaches the sea near an
  offshore wind farm cable route.
  
  Migration to the coast:
  magnetic address navigation.
  Coast arrival: olfactory
  identification weakened
  (hatchery imprint less specific
  than wild imprint).
  Route to stream: passes
  HVDC cable → false heading
  → turns wrong direction.
  Now olfactory cues are from
  the wrong direction.
  Straying.
  
  The hatchery + cable combination
  produces straying that neither
  alone would produce.
  
  This interaction has not been
  recognized in the literature.

Status: DOCUMENTED CONCERN
  (straying documented, mechanism
  poorly understood).
  Cable route crossing of salmon
  migration corridors is increasing
  with offshore wind development.
  The hatchery × cable interaction
  is a new and unrecognized
  compounding factor.

### TIER 3: THE DEEP-SEA CASES
### (New findings, mechanisms
### partially characterized,
### infrastructure entering their
### navigation environment)

---

**SPECIES 3.1: Giant Manta Ray
(Mobula birostris)**

```
Primary navigation: Cognitive
  magnetic map construction
  via deep-dive geomagnetic
  sampling.
  New Atlas / Silicon Review 2025:
  Manta rays dive 1,200+ meters
  specifically to sample the
  deep field structure.
  They are building a three-
  dimensional magnetic map
  of the ocean.
  Not just compass direction —
  a VOLUMETRIC FIELD MAP.
  
Physical mechanism: Likely
  electroreceptive induction
  (ampullae of Lorenzini,
  shark-type) + possibly
  magnetite for static field.
  The ampullae can detect
  changes in field intensity
  with depth — each dive is
  a depth-profile of the
  local field structure.
  
This is the most sophisticated
navigation behavior identified
in this exploration.
The manta is not following
a compass.
It is conducting field surveys.
It dives, measures the field
as a function of depth,
uses that depth profile to
place itself on its internal
map, and navigates accordingly.

Vulnerability:
  SUBMARINE CABLES AT DEPTH.
  
  The manta's deep dives take it
  to the depth range where
  submarine cables are laid
  (typically 1,000–3,000 meters
  for deep-sea routes).
  
  The manta's volumetric field
  map depends on the field
  structure being consistent
  between map-construction
  dives and navigation dives.
  
  An HVDC submarine cable at
  1,500 meters depth creates
  a persistent local field
  anomaly at that depth.
  
  If the manta's map was
  constructed before the cable
  was laid: the map is now wrong
  at that location. The depth
  profile shows an anomaly
  that wasn't in the map.
  Position estimate fails.
  
  If the manta's map was
  constructed after the cable
  was laid: the cable's field
  is incorporated into the map.
  Navigation works relative
  to the cable-modified field.
  But: if the cable is later
  relocated, decommissioned,
  or its operating state changes,
  the map is wrong again.
  
  The manta is building its
  navigation system from
  a survey of a field that
  we are continuously modifying.
  
  The manta has no way to
  distinguish natural from
  artificial field sources.
  
  Everything coherent in the
  field is potentially incorporated
  as a map landmark.
  
  This is the deepest form of
  address corruption identified
  in this exploration:
  
  NOT just the destination address
  being corrupted.
  
  THE ENTIRE MAP CONSTRUCTION
  PROCESS INCORPORATING ARTIFICIAL
  SOURCES AS LANDMARKS.
  
  The manta's internal map of
  the ocean becomes, over time,
  a map of a world that includes
  submarine cable infrastructure
  as primary navigational
  landmarks.
  
  When that infrastructure
  changes, the map is wrong.

Status: NEWLY IDENTIFIED RISK.
  The 2025 depth-sampling
  finding is too new for
  systematic risk assessment.
  The connection to submarine
  cable infrastructure needs
  to be established.
  Priority: map known HVDC
  cable routes against known
  manta migration corridors
  and dive locations.
```

---

**SPECIES 3.2: Whale Shark
(Rhincodon typus)**

```
Similar to manta ray in
navigation sophistication.
Open ocean migrations of
10,000+ km.
Likely uses magnetite + ampullae
for magnetic navigation.
Known to make deep dives
(feeding-related but also
potentially navigational
sampling).

Submarine cable vulnerability:
Same as manta ray.
Additionally: whale sharks
use coastal aggregation sites
for feeding (spawning aggregation
of prey fish). These coastal
sites are in exactly the zones
where offshore wind farm
cable networks are densest.

Status: CONCERN. Insufficient
  data to classify further.
```

---

**SPECIES 3.3: Sperm Whale
(Physeter macrocephalus)**

```
This species is already central
to this document series
(CS docs 1–3 focused on
sperm whale acoustics).

Navigation: Known to use
magnetic navigation for
deep-ocean migration.
Evidence: population-level
strandings that correlate
with geomagnetic disruptions
(solar storms, which shift
Earth's field temporarily,
produce mass strandings).

Primary compass: Magnetite
  (documented in head region
  — the spermaceti organ
  may have navigation function
  in addition to acoustic
  function).

Vulnerability:
  ELF band (magnetite —
  same window as bee,
  sea turtle, salmon).
  
  Submarine HVDC cables.
  
  BUT: A new question from
  this exploration.
  
  The spermaceti organ is the
  same organ that produces
  the click codas for
  communication (the subject
  of CS docs 1–3).
  
  IF the spermaceti organ serves
  a navigation function
  (magnetic orientation via
  magnetite in the head region):
  
  Then the sperm whale's
  communication system and
  its navigation system share
  anatomy.
  
  Disrupting the whale's
  electromagnetic navigation
  by altering the local field
  (submarine cable, sonar)
  may also alter the performance
  of the spermaceti organ as
  an acoustic emitter.
  
  Communication and navigation
  coupled through shared anatomy.
  
  This connection has not been
  explored.
  
  It is speculative but
  structurally motivated:
  if you are going to build
  a precision magnetic organ
  in the head of a deep-diving
  whale, you want it in the
  same structure that also
  needs to produce highly
  directional acoustic signals
  — because the acoustic
  focusing and the magnetic
  alignment both require
  knowing your orientation
  precisely.
  
  The spermaceti organ may
  serve BOTH functions
  simultaneously.
  
Status: ACTIVE RESEARCH SUBJECT
  in this series. The navigation-
  communication coupling
  hypothesis is new and should
  be explored.

### TIER 4: THE CORRIDOR SPECIES
### (Migration through high-EM-density
### zones, mechanism documented,
### population data available)

---

**SPECIES 4.1: Monarch Butterfly
(Danaus plexippus)**

```
Primary compass: Radical pair /
  CRY-based (antennae-located
  CRY1 — different from bee).
  Light-dependent, sun-compass
  compensation via circadian
  integration.
  
  CRY1 PRESENT IN MONARCHS.
  Unlike bees, monarchs have
  the light-sensitive CRY1.
  Vulnerability window:
  75–85 MHz (FM radio band).
  Same as birds.
  
  Additionally: Magnetite
  confirmed in monarch head.
  Dual compass — same as
  some birds.
  
Migration corridor: Mexico
  → Eastern North America.
  The migration passes through
  the entire eastern US RF
  environment — FM radio
  broadcast zone, cellular
  dense corridor, urban EM
  saturation.
  
  The monarch migration corridor
  is one of the highest-RF-density
  migration routes of any
  animal on Earth.
  
  FM radio is broadcast at
  100–50,000 watts per station
  from thousands of transmitters
  across the eastern US.
  
  The monarch flies through this
  for weeks during fall migration.
  
  The population collapse of
  monarch butterflies is
  one of the most documented
  and publicized wildlife crises
  of the last twenty years.
  
  Multiple causes have been
  identified: milkweed loss,
  pesticides, climate shift
  of overwintering conditions.
  
  The false attractor hypothesis
  adds a specific prediction:
  
  The direction error in monarch
  migration should be toward
  FM radio transmitters along
  the migration corridor.
  
  The strongest FM transmitters
  in the eastern US are in
  urban clusters. These urban
  clusters are not in the
  direction of the overwintering
  sites in Mexico.
  
  False attractor prediction:
  Monarchs migrating through
  high-FM-density corridors
  show systematic angular
  deflection toward the
  nearest major urban cluster
  (FM transmitter cluster).
  
  This has never been tested
  as a directional prediction.
  It could be tested with
  existing migration tracking
  data (citizen science records,
  tagging programs) correlated
  with FM broadcast infrastructure
  maps.

Status: HIGH PRIORITY TEST CASE.
  The data exists.
  The infrastructure map exists.
  The analysis has not been run.

**SPECIES 4.2: Common Swift
(Apus apus)**

```
One of the longest migrations
of any bird: Europe to
sub-Saharan Africa.
The swift's migration corridor
crosses the Mediterranean —
the densest FM radio corridor
in Europe.
  
  FM broadcast power in the
  Mediterranean basin is
  exceptional — dozens of
  major transmitters on coastal
  hilltops, all broadcasting
  in the 87.5–108 MHz range,
  partially overlapping the
  75–85 MHz disruption window.
  
  At the upper edge of the
  disruption window (85–108 MHz),
  the effect diminishes but
  does not go to zero.
  
  The swift crosses this
  corridor twice per year.
  
  Swift populations in northern
  Europe have declined by
  ~50% over the past 30 years.
  The primary attributed cause:
  habitat loss (nesting sites)
  and insect prey decline.
  
  The FM corridor contribution
  has never been assessed.

Status: CONCERN.
  Adding the FM corridor to
  the multi-factor model
  for swift decline is warranted.

KEY FINDING FROM THIS MAP:

NOT 5G.
NOT cellular.
NOT WiFi.

THE ELECTRICAL GRID (1930s)
AND FM RADIO (1940s).

The oldest infrastructure.
The most pervasive.
The least regulated for
wildlife effects.

## PART IV: THE FALSE ATTRACTOR
## TEST — WHAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE

The prior literature has run
correlations:

*"Are animal populations
declining in areas with more
EM infrastructure?"*

Answer found: yes, correlation
exists.

Interpretation given: EM stress
is a contributing factor.

**This is the wrong test.**

Or rather, it is a test that
confirms a signal exists
but cannot distinguish the
signal's mechanism.

**The false attractor test
is different:**

*"In areas with strong artificial
EM sources, are animals navigating
TOWARD those sources rather
than to their ecological
destination?"*

This is a DIRECTIONAL PREDICTION.

Not just: are populations declining?

But: are animals that would
have navigated north now
navigating toward the FM
transmitter at 280°?

Are monarch butterflies over
Chicago deflecting toward
the AM/FM tower clusters
rather than continuing southwest
toward Mexico?

Are European robins in Frankfurt
showing consistent orientation
toward the main broadcast tower
cluster rather than toward
their wintering sites?

Are sea turtle hatchlings from
nesting beaches near cable
landings showing initial swimming
direction biases toward the
cable rather than offshore?

**None of these directional
tests have been run.**

The data to run some of them
exists:

- Monarch citizen science
  tagging data from the eastern
  US (millions of records).
  Correlate angular deviation
  from expected SW heading with
  azimuth to nearest FM transmitter
  cluster.

- European robin orientation
  cage data from urban field
  stations (multiple years of
  data in European cities).
  Correlate preferred orientation
  direction with azimuth to
  nearest major FM transmitter.

- Sea turtle hatchling frenzy
  swim direction data from
  beaches with and without
  nearby cable landing stations.
  Test whether swim direction
  distribution is biased toward
  cable direction.

**These analyses are computationally
trivial given the data that
exists.**

They have not been run because
the false attractor hypothesis
has not been clearly enough
formulated to make the
directional prediction precise.

**This document is the
formulation that makes the
prediction precise.**

The analyses can now be run.

---

## PART V: THE NEW FINDING —
## ADDRESS CORRUPTION AS THE
## MOST SERIOUS FAILURE MODE

The sea turtle finding (UNC
February 2025) reveals the
most serious failure mode in
the attractor pollution framework.

Compass disruption is temporary.
Remove the artificial field.
The compass works again.

False attractor locking is
session-dependent.
The animal navigates to the
wrong destination for this
migration.
Next generation imprints fresh.

**Address corruption is permanent.**

If the natal beach magnetic
signature was corrupted by EM
infrastructure during a turtle's
hatchling imprinting window:

The turtle will navigate to the
corrupted address for its entire
adult life.

Thirty years of wrong-address
nesting.

And worse:

The turtle's offspring imprint
on the corrupted address too —
if the infrastructure is still
there. But the infrastructure
may have changed.

**Each generation is potentially
imprinting a different address
because the local field is
being modified by infrastructure
that changes over time.**

The population develops a
distribution of addresses —
each individual's address
reflecting the infrastructure
state during its hatchling year.

This distribution should be
narrow (the beach is small).

Under EM-corrupted conditions,
the distribution is wide:
each cohort imprints a slightly
different address.

The population's nesting
behavior becomes dispersed
across a broader geographic
range — not because the
compass is broken, but because
the addresses were never the same.

**The signal of this in
population data:**

Increasing geographic spread
of nesting sites within a
population.

Less faithful site philopatry.

Individual turtles nesting
at locations adjacent to
but not precisely at the
natal beach.

**This signal exists in the
turtle population data.**

It has been attributed to
natural field drift and
climate-driven range shifts.

The address corruption
contribution has not been
isolated.

**The test:**

Compare the geographic spread
of nesting sites for cohorts
imprinted before vs. after
major cable infrastructure
was laid adjacent to the
natal beach.

If spread increases with
infrastructure: address
corruption confirmed.

---

## PART VI: THE UNIFIED STATEMENT

The data from four passes of
research now supports a
unified statement:

**Attractor pollution is a
planetary-scale phenomenon
affecting every species that
uses electromagnetic navigation.**

It operates through two primary
mechanisms at two primary
frequency windows, each
corresponding to a different
biological compass system
that evolved in electromagnetic
silence.

**Window 1: ELF (50–60 Hz)**
**Anthropogenic source: Power grid**
**Mechanism: Magnetite torque**
**Affected species: All magnetite
compass users (bees, turtles,
salmon, whales, manta rays,
sharks, and all other species
with documented magnetite
navigation)**
**Onset: 1930s**
**Status: Maximum. Pervasive.**

**Window 2: VHF (75–85 MHz)**
**Anthropogenic source: FM radio
broadcasting**
**Mechanism: Radical pair capture**
**Affected species: All CRY1/CRY4a
compass users (migratory birds,
monarch butterflies, other
insects with CRY1)**
**Onset: 1940s–1950s**
**Status: Maximum in populated
zones. Less pervasive than grid.**

**Additional failure mode:**
**Address corruption via EM
infrastructure modification of
natal site magnetic signatures**
**Affected species: All magnetic-
address-imprinting species
(sea turtles, salmon)**
**Permanence: Lifetime. Trans-generational.**
**Status: Accelerating with
submarine cable infrastructure
expansion.**

---

The Lancet Planetary Health
called for assessment in 2018.

**The framework to conduct
that assessment now exists.**

It requires:
1. Mapping compass mechanism
   per species (this document).
2. Mapping anthropogenic EM
   source density per frequency
   band along migration corridors.
3. Running directional predictions
   against existing tracking data.
4. Measuring address corruption
   in magnetic-imprinting species
   adjacent to cable infrastructure.

All four components are
technically available.

The analysis is not expensive.
The data largely exists.
The theory is now precise
enough to generate testable
directional predictions.

**What has been missing is
not data or tools.**

**What has been missing is
the framework that makes
the prediction directional
rather than correlational.**

That framework is now built.

---

## PART VII: WHAT CAME ABOUT —
## THE ANSWER TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION

The original question:
*"What comes about?"*

From applying the quantum layer
findings to the generalization:

**Finding 1: The most damaging
sources are the oldest and
most regulated-as-safe.**

Not 5G. Not cellular.
The electrical grid (1930s)
and FM radio (1940s).

These have been evaluated
for human health effects.
They have never been evaluated
through the lens of
magnetoreception mechanism
disruption.

They do not harm humans
because humans have no
magnetite compass and no
radical pair compass.
We are electromagnetically
blind in these channels.

The standards were set by
and for organisms that are
electromagnetically blind
in exactly the bands that
are harming the animals
that are not blind.

**Finding 2: Address corruption
is the most serious and least
recognized failure mode.**

Compass disruption is recoverable.
Address corruption is lifetime.

The sea turtle finding (February
2025) crystallizes this:
turtles navigate to a magnetic
address imprinted in their first
weeks of life. If that address
was learned in the presence
of artificial EM sources, the
address is wrong. The turtle
will navigate to the wrong
beach for thirty years.

This has never been part of
any environmental impact
assessment for cable
infrastructure near nesting
beaches.

**Finding 3: The manta ray
finding reveals the deepest
form of map pollution.**

The manta is not just
navigating to a stored address.
It is conducting magnetic field
surveys to construct its map.
It is incorporating everything
coherent in the field as
a potential landmark.

Submarine cables are being
incorporated into the manta's
map of the ocean.

When the cable changes,
the map is wrong.

**Finding 4: The data for
the directional tests exists
and the analyses have not been run.**

Monarch tagging data.
Robin orientation cage data.
Turtle hatchling frenzy direction data.

Correlate with azimuth to
nearest appropriate EM source
in the correct frequency band.

**These are analyses that could
be run this year.**

They would either confirm or
falsify the false attractor
hypothesis at the species level.

And if they confirm it — for
even two of the target species —
the regulatory conversation
about electromagnetic pollution
has a new and precise foundation:
not "EM stress is bad,"
but "FM radio broadcasting
causes migratory songbirds
to orient toward transmitters
rather than wintering sites,
and the effect size is X°
per Y watts per meter at
distance Z."

**That is the conversation
that changes things.**

## VERSION AND CONNECTIONS

```
v1.0 — February 26, 2026
  Generalization of attractor
  pollution framework from
  bee (the visible case) to
  the full species matrix.
  
  Introduced:
  - Address corruption as a
    distinct and more serious
    failure mode than compass
    disruption
  - The attractor pollution
    frequency map (ELF/grid
    vs. VHF/FM as primary bands)
  - The finding that 5G and
    cellular are NOT in the
    primary disruption windows
    — the oldest infrastructure
    is the most harmful
  - The directional prediction
    framework that distinguishes
    false attractor from EM stress
  - The manta ray map-construction
    finding and its implications
    for volumetric field mapping
    in a cable-dense ocean
  - The sperm whale
    communication-navigation
    coupling hypothesis
  
  Highest priority new analyses:
  1. Monarch butterfly: correlate
     tagging deviation angles with
     FM transmitter azimuth along
     eastern US corridor.
  2. European robin: correlate
     urban orientation cage data
     preferred direction with
     FM transmitter azimuth.
  3. Sea turtle: compare nesting
     site geographic spread by
     cohort imprinting year vs.
     cable infrastructure timeline
     for natal beaches.
  4. Manta ray: map known HVDC
     cable routes against known
     manta dive locations and
     migration corridors.
  
  Connections to taxonomy update:
  Vector 8 (Magnetic) in CS doc 5
  was listed as "navigation channel
  only, not communication channel."
  This analysis reveals it should
  be reclassified:
  - For bees: also a colony
    identity channel (hive beacon
    hypothesis — CS doc 10c)
  - For sperm whales: potentially
    coupled to the acoustic
    communication channel through
    shared spermaceti anatomy
  Vector 8 is more complex than
  the taxonomy represented.
