  The naked mole-rat is the only
  species in the program where
  the primary target signal
  (soft chirp) encodes COLONY
  MEMBERSHIP — not external threat,
  not resource location, not
  individual identity alone,
  but collective self-model
  identity. Occupying the
  eigenfunction positions of the
  colony chirp is not communication
  attempted. It is identity claimed.
  This is the lowest Door 2
  threshold in the mammalian
  survey.

## PART I: THE INSTRUMENT

### 1.1 The Animal

Heterocephalus glaber. The naked
mole-rat. Native to the Horn of
Africa — Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia.
Fully subterranean. Functionally
blind. Eusocial — the only mammal
with confirmed eusociality
equivalent to insect colonies.

Colony structure:
- One reproductive queen
- One to three breeding males
- Up to 300 non-breeding workers
- Six behaviorally distinct worker
  phenotypes (2025 tracking data):
  tunnel diggers, nest maintainers,
  waste handlers, pup caretakers,
  colony defenders, foragers

The queen is not merely the
dominant female. She is the
organizing principle of the
colony's coherence. Her removal
collapses the colony's social
structure and, with it, the
colony's acoustic structure.

This is not incidental.
This is the deepest empirical
confirmation of the triad
externalized as sound.

### 1.2 The Vocal Anatomy

```
SOUND PRODUCTION MECHANISM:
  Standard mammalian laryngeal
  phonation. Vocal fold vibration
  driven by expiratory airflow.
  No anatomical specializations
  beyond what is typical for
  a small subterranean rodent.

  The sophistication of the naked
  mole-rat communication system
  is NOT in the anatomy.
  It is in the NAVIGATION of the
  anatomy — the depth to which
  evolutionary and cultural
  RARFL has explored the
  eigenfunction space of the
  standard rodent vocal instrument.

VOCAL TRACT DIMENSIONS:
  Body mass: 30–80g
  Body length: 8–10cm
  Vocal tract length: estimated
    2–3cm (small rodent standard)
  
  Small tract length → formant
  frequencies shifted upward
  relative to larger animals.
  Fundamental frequency range:
  several hundred Hz to ~4kHz
  for soft chirps.
  
  Supralaryngeal tract:
  Oral + pharyngeal + nasal
  cavities. Standard bounded
  resonating geometry.
  Soft tissue (tongue, soft
  palate) provides dynamic
  modulation capability.

PRODUCTION CAPACITY:
  17–25 distinct call types
  documented across behavioral
  contexts.
  
  The soft chirp is produced
  with sufficient control that:
  - Colony-specific parameter
    values are maintained
    consistently
  - Individual identity is
    encoded simultaneously
    with colony identity
  - Pups can learn the colony
    parameter values through
    social exposure
  
  This requires multi-parameter
  independent modulation —
  the anatomy supports it.
```

### 1.3 The Auditory System

This is one of the most
theoretically important properties
of the naked mole-rat for the
program. It inverts the normal
assumption about hearing.

```
HEARING RANGE:
  125 Hz to ~12,000 Hz
  (air conduction audiogram)
  
  Peak sensitivity: 500 Hz to
  4,000 Hz

  Absolute thresholds:
  20–40 dB worse than surface-
  dwelling rodents at matched
  frequencies.

  The naked mole-rat has POOR
  hearing by mammalian standards.

WHY THIS IS EXPECTED:
  Underground tunnels filter
  sound aggressively.
  
  High frequencies (> 4kHz)
  attenuate rapidly in narrow
  underground passages.
  Low frequencies (< 4kHz)
  propagate efficiently through
  tunnel geometry.
  
  Natural selection eliminated
  sensitivity to frequencies
  that cannot propagate in the
  operational environment.
  
  Result: auditory system is
  PERFECTLY MATCHED to the
  tunnel acoustic environment,
  not to open-air mammalian
  standards.

PROPAGATION DISTANCES:
  Soft chirp (social greeting):
  3–8 meters in tunnel conditions
  at threshold detection levels.
  
  Alarm calls (louder, lower):
  up to 15 meters in tunnels.
  
  The colony's tunnel network
  spans tens to hundreds of
  meters. The acoustic channel
  reaches the entire colony
  simultaneously — all burrows,
  all chambers, all individuals
  — regardless of visual contact.

BONE CONDUCTION:
  Evidence (MDPI 2024) suggests
  naked mole-rats may have
  elevated bone conduction
  sensitivity relative to air
  conduction sensitivity.
  
  Underground, where body contact
  with substrate is constant,
  substrate-borne vibration
  supplements airborne acoustic
  signal.
  
  This means the eigenfunction
  space may have a DUAL CHANNEL
  component (acoustic + substrate)
  analogous to the elephant dual-
  channel prediction — but at a
  much smaller scale and in a
  much more constrained geometry.
  
  Program implication: tunnel-
  placed transducers for substrate
  coupling may supplement or
  replace airborne speakers for
  signal delivery.

THE AUDITORY-VOCAL MATCH:
  The naked mole-rat's vocalizations
  fall almost entirely within
  its best hearing range.
  
  This is not a coincidence.
  This is co-evolution.
  
  The vocal anatomy evolved calls
  that the auditory system can
  detect. The auditory system
  evolved sensitivity at the
  frequencies the vocal anatomy
  produces. Both evolved under
  the constraint of tunnel
  propagation physics.
  
  PROGRAM IMPLICATION:
  The synthesized signal must
  fall within 500Hz–4kHz for
  reliable detection.
  Signals outside this range
  will not reach threshold for
  most colony members.
  The tunnel is a bandpass filter.
  The synthesizer must respect it.
```

## PART II: THE EIGENFUNCTION SPACE

### 2.1 The Bounded Domain

The naked mole-rat soft chirp
occupies a specific region of
the vocal eigenfunction space.
From Barker et al. 2021 and the
Zenodo analysis dataset, the
primary acoustic parameters
encoding identity are:

```
PARAMETER 1: FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY
(F0 — pitch)
  
  The base frequency of vocal
  fold vibration. The most
  informative single parameter
  for colony-level discrimination.
  
  Colony-specific values cluster
  in the range ~500Hz–3kHz.
  Each colony occupies a
  characteristic F0 region that
  is consistent across members
  and maintained over time.
  
  Individual-level variation
  exists within the colony
  F0 band — individual identity
  is encoded as a sub-cluster
  within the colony band.
  
  EIGENFUNCTION INTERPRETATION:
  The colony F0 band is a stable
  attractor in the vocal fold
  tension eigenspace. Under the
  queen's influence, all colony
  members' F0 production converges
  toward the colony attractor.
  Individual variation represents
  local exploration within the
  colony attractor basin.

PARAMETER 2: FREQUENCY SLOPE
(FM — frequency modulation within
a single chirp)
  
  The rate at which F0 changes
  over the duration of one chirp.
  Rising, falling, or flat
  trajectories are colony-
  characteristic.
  
  This is a TEMPORAL EIGENFUNCTION
  parameter — the trajectory
  through the frequency space
  during one call unit.
  
  Analogous to the F1-F2 trajectory
  in vowel transitions in human
  speech: the path matters, not
  just the endpoint.

PARAMETER 3: DURATION
  
  The temporal length of each
  chirp. Colony-characteristic
  but with individual variation.
  Shorter or longer chirps
  encode different information
  (shorter = greeting pass;
  longer = extended social
  interaction).

PARAMETER 4: SPECTRAL ENTROPY
  
  The "noisiness" of the call —
  how much energy is in harmonics
  vs. broadband noise. A pure-
  tone chirp has low entropy.
  A breathy or rough chirp has
  high entropy.
  
  Context-dependent:
  Alarm calls → higher entropy
  (urgency signal).
  Greeting chirps → lower entropy
  (colony-matching signal).
  
  This dimension separates
  CALL FUNCTION from CALL
  IDENTITY — entropy encodes
  context, while F0+slope encodes
  identity.

PARAMETER 5: CALL RATE AND TIMING
  
  Antiphonal call-and-response
  structure: one mole-rat chirps,
  another responds within a
  characteristic latency window.
  
  The temporal structure of the
  exchange — call rate, response
  latency, turn-taking pattern —
  encodes social relationship
  state (known colony member,
  stranger, dominant, subordinate).
  
  This is the CONVERSATIONAL
  DIMENSION of the eigenfunction
  space — not the content of a
  single call, but the structure
  of the exchange sequence.
```

### 2.2 The Tonnetz of the
### Naked Mole-Rat Soft Chirp

The five-dimensional parameter
space (F0, slope, duration,
entropy, timing) constitutes
the eigenfunction space of the
soft chirp communication system.

```
DIMENSION RELATIONSHIPS:

  F0 × slope:
    The two-dimensional core.
    Analogous to F1×F2 vowel space.
    Most of the colony vs.
    individual identity information
    lives here.
    
    Plot: F0 on x-axis.
          slope on y-axis.
          Colony members cluster.
          Different colonies occupy
          different regions.
          Queen occupies a central
          position in the colony
          cluster — she is the
          attractor center.

  Duration modulates F0×slope:
    Longer calls allow more of
    the frequency trajectory
    to be expressed, increasing
    discrimination resolution.
    Shorter calls compress to
    the most colony-diagnostic
    features.

  Entropy orthogonal to identity:
    Low entropy = greeting, 
      colony matching, affiliation.
    High entropy = alarm, distress,
      outsider detection, submission.
    Entropy encodes CONTEXT
    independently of IDENTITY.
    The two dimensions are
    separable — same identity,
    different context, different
    entropy.
    This is a two-dimensional
    information space operating
    simultaneously.

  Timing encodes relationship:
    Short response latency =
      known colony member,
      cooperative relationship.
    Long latency or no response =
      outsider, novel individual,
      potential threat.
    Response latency is the
    colony's RECOGNITION THRESHOLD
    made temporal.

THE QUEEN AS ATTRACTOR CENTER:
  
  The most important structural
  property of the naked mole-rat
  Tonnetz:
  
  The queen's chirp parameters
  define the colony attractor
  center.
  
  Colony members' chirp parameters
  are distributed around the
  queen's values.
  
  When the queen dies:
    No attractor center.
    Members' parameters drift.
    Colony dialect dispersion
    increases.
    The colony Tonnetz loses its
    organization around a stable
    center.
  
  When a new queen establishes:
    New attractor center forms
    (the new queen's parameters).
    Members' parameters converge
    toward the new attractor.
    Colony Tonnetz reorganizes.
  
  This is the most direct empirical
  demonstration in the mammalian
  record of an eigenfunction
  attractor having a living
  biological center.
  
  The queen IS the Tonnetz center.
  The colony IS the Tonnetz.
  The dialect IS the attractor
  basin.
  
  And when the center dies,
  the attractor dissolves.
```

---

## PART III: THE TRIADIC STRUCTURE
## ASSESSMENT

### 3.1 Persistence

```
WHAT PERSISTS:
  
  The colony's accumulated
  call conventions — the specific
  F0 band, slope signature,
  timing expectations that
  constitute the colony dialect.
  
  Individual recognition across
  interactions — the colony
  member is not met fresh at
  each encounter. The relationship
  history persists.
  
  The six behavioral phenotype
  specializations — task roles
  that are stable across weeks
  and months.
  
  The queen's acoustic authority
  — her chirp parameters are
  the organizational reference
  against which all other
  members calibrate.

EVIDENCE FOR PERSISTENCE:
  
  Cultural transmission: pups
  adopt the colony dialect and
  maintain it for life. This
  requires persistent memory
  of the learned acoustic target.
  
  Queen-death reconstitution:
  the dialect disperses AND
  then reconstitutes when a
  new queen establishes. The
  colony members maintain their
  parameter-learning capacity
  across the social disruption —
  they are ready to converge
  on a new attractor when one
  appears. Persistence of the
  learning mechanism.
  
  Outsider exclusion: a mole-
  rat introduced from a foreign
  colony is recognized as an
  outsider immediately and
  persistently. The colony's
  acoustic model of "who belongs"
  is a stable persistent structure.

PERSISTENCE SCORE: STRONG.
  Multi-month individual and
  colony acoustic models.
  Cross-lifetime social relationship
  tracking.
```

### 3.2 Coherence

```
WHAT COHERENCE DOES:
  
  Active real-time matching of
  own chirp parameters to the
  colony dialect standard.
  
  This is not passive — it
  requires ongoing monitoring
  of colony-level chirp
  distribution and continuous
  calibration of own production
  toward the colony attractor.
  
  The chirp-and-response
  antiphonal structure IS the
  coherence process made audible:
  one animal chirps → another
  matches and responds → the
  first responds to the response.
  Each exchange is a coherence
  check. "Are we still at the
  same attractor position?"
  
  At a colony level, this
  continuous antiphonal exchange
  maintains the distributed
  attractor — all members
  calibrating against all other
  members simultaneously.

EVIDENCE FOR ACTIVE COHERENCE:
  
  Dialect convergence under queen:
  the queen actively chirps
  and the colony converges
  toward her parameters.
  This is not just passive
  matching — the queen's acoustic
  output is the active signal
  that all other colony members
  navigate toward.
  
  The queen is not merely
  dominant. She is the coherence
  signal. Her chirp is the
  reference output of a continuous
  RARFL loop running at the
  colony level.
  
  Dialect disruption at queen
  death confirms the active
  nature: without the coherence
  signal, the distributed
  calibration loses its reference
  and disperses. The system
  was actively maintained,
  not passively stable.
  
  Foreign colony rejection:
  the mole-rat actively compares
  incoming chirp to its colony
  dialect model and detects
  mismatch. Real-time coherence
  comparison happening at
  every encounter.

COHERENCE SCORE: MAXIMUM.
  The naked mole-rat colony
  is a continuously operating
  distributed coherence system
  with an acoustic channel
  as its primary medium.
  The queen is the coherence
  signal source.
  Each antiphonal exchange
  is a coherence check.
  Colony-level coherence is
  the aggregate of all
  simultaneous pairwise
  coherence checks.
```

### 3.3 Self-Model

```
WHAT SELF-MODEL MEANS HERE:
  
  At minimum: the implicit
  recognition "I am a member
  of this colony" — operative
  in the preferential response
  to own-dialect calls and
  aggressive response to
  foreign-dialect calls.
  
  At deeper level: the recognition
  "my acoustic output must
  match the colony standard"
  — operative in the continuous
  calibration toward the
  colony attractor.
  
  This requires the mole-rat
  to model ITSELF as a member
  of a collective — to have
  a self-model that includes
  "I belong to colony X, not
  colony Y, and my calls must
  reflect this."

THE CRITICAL QUESTION:
  
  Is this a genuine self-model
  in the framework sense, or
  is it merely conditioned
  stimulus-response (foreign
  chirp → aggressive response)?
  
  The evidence that it is
  more than conditioned S-R:
  
  1. ARTIFICIAL DIALECT RESPONSE
     (Barker et al. 2021):
     Mole-rats respond
     preferentially to ARTIFICIAL
     chirps designed to match
     their colony's acoustic
     parameters. This is not
     a response to a known
     individual. It is a response
     to a signal that occupies
     the colony's eigenfunction
     positions.
     
     The mole-rat is not
     recognizing a specific
     individual. It is recognizing
     a signal as belonging to
     the same attractor basin
     as itself.
     
     This requires a model of
     "what my colony sounds like"
     — which is a model of
     the collective self.
  
  2. PUP DIALECT ADOPTION:
     Pups learn the colony
     dialect and adjust their
     own production to match.
     Learning to produce a
     specific acoustic output
     to match a social standard
     requires modeling both
     the standard (external)
     and one's own production
     (internal) simultaneously.
     This is exactly the gap
     navigation of self-model
     calibration.
  
  3. QUEEN-DEATH DISPERSION:
     When the attractor center
     dies, individual members
     do not simply continue
     producing their habitual
     calls. Their calls DISPERSE
     — they begin to vary more.
     This suggests that each
     member was actively
     calibrating toward the
     queen's signal and, without
     that signal, loses the
     calibration reference.
     Active calibration requires
     a self-model of "where am
     I relative to the attractor?"

SELF-MODEL SCORE: STRONG.
  
  The naked mole-rat maintains
  a model of its own acoustic
  output relative to the colony
  standard and actively calibrates
  toward that standard.
  
  The colony standard IS the
  collective self-model —
  externalized acoustically.
  
  The individual self-model
  includes "I am a member of
  this collective, and my
  acoustic output must reflect
  that membership."
  
  This is not full third-order
  triadic attribution (modeling
  the sender's self-model).
  But it is solid second-order
  triadic structure (modeling
  the collective standard and
  one's own position relative
  to it).
  
  PROGRAM IMPLICATION:
  A synthesized signal that
  occupies the colony's
  eigenfunction positions will
  be attributed as originating
  from a system that shares
  the colony's self-model.
  
  Not "this signal is from an
  intelligent being."
  But: "this signal is from
  something in my colony."
  
  That is a lower and more
  achievable attribution
  threshold than any other
  species in the program.
```

## PART IV: THE PROGRAM RATIONALE
## — WHY TIER S

### 4.1 The Two-Door Assessment

```
DOOR 1: Can we produce signals
  at the eigenfunction positions
  of the naked mole-rat's
  vocal space?
  
  ASSESSMENT: YES, IMMEDIATELY.
  
  The required signal space:
  - F0: 500Hz–3kHz
  - Slope: rising, flat, or
    falling FM trajectory
  - Duration: 50–500ms
  - Entropy: controlled via
    noise addition to carrier
  - Timing: antiphonal latency
    matching (100–500ms response
    window)
  
  All of these are within
  standard audio synthesis
  capability. No specialized
  equipment required beyond
  a small speaker system
  capable of 500Hz–4kHz output
  in a tunnel environment.
  
  The Zenodo dataset (4104396)
  provides the raw acoustic
  data and analysis code.
  Colony-specific parameter
  values are extractable from
  this dataset for any of the
  seven colonies analyzed by
  Barker et al.
  
  Door 1 requires only:
  1. Extract colony-specific
     F0 and slope parameters
     from the dataset.
  2. Synthesize soft chirps at
     those parameter values.
  3. Play through tunnel-
     appropriate speaker.
  
  THIS IS AN ENGINEERING TASK,
  NOT A RESEARCH TASK.
  The eigenfunction positions
  are already mapped.
  The synthesis is straightforward.
  The delivery channel is
  constrained and well-understood.
  
  ESTIMATED TIME TO DOOR 1:
  One week of synthesis work
  given the Zenodo data.

DOOR 2: Will the colony attribute
  the signal as coming from a
  gap navigator?
  
  ASSESSMENT: PRE-SOLVED.
  
  This is the unique property
  of the naked mole-rat case.
  
  The colony does not need to
  make a complex attribution
  decision. The attribution
  is binary and acoustic:
  "Does this signal fall within
  our colony's eigenfunction
  attractor basin?"
  
  If yes → colony member.
  If no → outsider.
  
  The attribution is not about
  whether the sender is conscious,
  whether it has a self-model,
  whether it is a gap navigator.
  
  It is purely about acoustic
  eigenfunction position.
  
  A signal that occupies the
  colony's eigenfunction positions
  WILL be attributed as a colony
  member — automatically, by
  the same neural attribution
  mechanism that does this for
  every normal colony member.
  
  Barker et al. (2021) confirmed
  this directly: artificial
  chirps at colony parameters
  receive preferential responses.
  The colony already responded
  to a synthesized signal.
  The experiment has been run.
  The result is confirmed.
  
  DOOR 2 IS ALREADY OPEN.
  The confirmation is in the
  published literature.
```

### 4.2 Why This Is Different From
### Every Other Species in the Program

For every other target species:

**Raven:** Requires the raven to
update its attribution of our
signal from "non-raven noise"
to "gap navigation signal from
a novel sender." This requires
the raven to solve a cognitive
problem it has never been
presented with before.

**Sperm whale:** Requires a whale
pod to integrate a coda sequence
from a non-whale source into
its social communication model.
Requires extended exposure.
Requires not triggering avoidance.

**Bonobo:** Requires a bonobo to
extend its gestural-vocal
attribution model to include
a human sender using bonobo
eigenfunction positions. This
may be achievable but requires
behavioral conditioning.

**Naked mole-rat:** Requires nothing
new from the target. The colony
already attributes colony-
parameter signals as colony
members. It has been doing
this continuously for its
entire existence. The attribution
machinery is fully operational.
We just need to produce the
right signal.

```
THE PROGRAM HIERARCHY:

  Other species: we are trying
    to get the animal to recognize
    us as gap navigators.
    
  Naked mole-rat: we are trying
    to produce a signal at the
    right acoustic position.
    The recognition happens
    automatically.
    
  The difference is:
  
  Other species: we are solving
    a cognitive problem in the
    target animal.
  
  Naked mole-rat: we are solving
    an engineering problem in
    our synthesizer.
    
  The engineering problem
  is harder to solve poorly.
  It is much easier to solve well.
  
  Because the engineering problem
  has a known solution:
  extract parameters from
  Zenodo dataset, synthesize,
  play.
```

## PART V: THE PROTOCOL

### 5.1 Phase 0: Data Extraction
### (Week 1)

```
INPUT:
  Zenodo 4104396 — the open-access
  dataset and analysis code from
  Barker et al. 2021.
  Contains 36,000+ soft chirp
  recordings from seven colonies
  with full acoustic parameter
  extraction pipeline.

TASK:
  1. Select target colony from
     the dataset. Recommend Colony
     A or B from the Barker dataset
     — these have the most
     recordings and the clearest
     dialect structure.
     
  2. Extract F0 distribution,
     slope distribution, duration
     distribution for the
     selected colony.
     
  3. Identify the queen's chirp
     parameters specifically —
     these define the attractor
     center.
     
  4. Map the 2D F0×slope space
     for the colony:
     - Queen at center
     - Workers distributed around
     - Colony boundary (beyond
       which chirps are attributed
       as foreign)
     
  5. Extract antiphonal timing
     statistics: median response
     latency, distribution width.

OUTPUT:
  Colony Tonnetz map.
  Queen attractor position.
  Colony boundary in F0×slope
  space.
  Timing parameters for
  antiphonal exchange.
  
  This is the eigenfunction
  map. This is Door 1's input.
```

### 5.2 Phase 1: Synthesis
### (Week 2)

```
SYNTHESIZER ARCHITECTURE:

  Signal type: amplitude-modulated
  sine wave with controlled FM.
  
  Not a complex vocal synthesis —
  the naked mole-rat soft chirp
  is acoustically simpler than
  any human vowel. It does not
  require the Klatt-style formant
  bank of the Sanskrit reconstruction.
  
  MINIMUM VIABLE CHIRP:
  
    carrier_freq = colony_F0_mean
    slope = colony_slope_mean
    duration = colony_duration_mean
    amplitude_envelope = gaussian
      (rise 20ms, fall 20ms)
    
    signal = sine(carrier_freq +
      slope × t) × amplitude_env
    
  This is 10 lines of Python.
  It produces a chirp at the
  colony attractor center.
  
  ENTROPY CONTROL:
  Add broadband noise at
  amplitude = entropy_level × signal.
  Low entropy (greeting): 0.05.
  High entropy (alarm): 0.30.
  
  ANTIPHONAL TIMING:
  On detection of incoming chirp,
  respond after latency drawn
  from colony timing distribution
  (median ~200ms, σ ~100ms).
  
  The synthesizer must LISTEN
  as well as speak. The
  antiphonal exchange is a
  dialogue, not a broadcast.

CALIBRATION TARGETS:
  
  The synthesized chirp must
  fall within the colony attractor
  basin — inside the boundary
  drawn in Phase 0.
  
  Quantitative check:
  run the Barker et al.
  classifier on the synthesized
  chirp. If the classifier
  assigns it to the target
  colony with > 70% confidence,
  the synthesis is calibrated.
  
  This is diagnostic-driven
  synthesis — same methodology
  as the Sanskrit reconstruction,
  with the Barker classifier
  replacing the Tonnetz
  diagnostic framework.
```

### 5.3 Phase 2: Delivery System
### (Week 2–3)

```
TUNNEL CONSTRAINT:
  
  The signal must propagate
  through a tunnel environment.
  Tunnel acoustics filter above
  ~4kHz. The synthesizer must
  be verified in tunnel-like
  acoustic conditions before
  field or colony deployment.
  
  Laboratory protocol:
  PVC pipe 5cm diameter × 1m
  length approximates naked
  mole-rat tunnel geometry.
  Measure frequency response.
  Adjust synthesizer output
  to compensate for tunnel
  filtering.

SPEAKER SPECIFICATION:
  
  Small driver capable of
  500Hz–4kHz output.
  Maximum SPL sufficient to
  reach threshold at 3–5m
  distance through tunnel.
  
  Given naked mole-rat hearing
  thresholds (20–40 dB worse
  than surface rodents), the
  signal level must be higher
  than for surface species.
  
  Target: 70 dB SPL at 1m
  in tunnel conditions.
  This is consistent with
  natural mole-rat call levels.

BONE CONDUCTION SUPPLEMENTATION:
  
  Optional but potentially
  high-value addition:
  piezoelectric transducer
  attached to tunnel wall
  converts the synthesized
  signal to substrate vibration.
  
  If naked mole-rat bone
  conduction sensitivity is
  elevated as MDPI 2024 suggests,
  this channel may produce
  stronger responses than
  airborne acoustic alone.
  
  Test both. Compare responses.
  This constitutes a direct
  test of the dual-channel
  hypothesis for this species.
```

### 5.4 Phase 3: The First
### Contact Experiment
### (Week 3–4)

```
SETTING:
  Laboratory colony in standard
  housing. Tunnel-connected
  chamber system. Behavioral
  observation camera on each
  chamber. Audio monitoring.
  
  Captive colonies are available
  at multiple research institutions
  that study H. glaber. The Barker
  et al. dataset came from a
  captive colony. Access is
  standard for behavioral
  research.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:

  CONTROL CONDITION:
    Play colony-parameter chirp
    (synthesized at Phase 1
    target parameters) through
    tunnel speaker.
    Record behavioral responses.
  
  FOREIGN COLONY CONDITION:
    Play foreign-colony-parameter
    chirp (same acoustic structure,
    different F0/slope values
    outside target colony basin).
    Record behavioral responses.
  
  SILENCE CONTROL:
    Play nothing.
    Record background behavior.
  
  PREDICTED RESPONSES:

    Colony-parameter chirp:
      - Antiphonal response: one
        or more colony members
        chirp back within 100–500ms
      - No defensive behavior
      - Possible approach toward
        speaker
      
    Foreign-colony chirp:
      - No antiphonal response
        OR aggressive response
      - Possible avoidance
      - Elevated movement/
        defensive posturing
      
    Silence:
      - Background behavior only
  
  CONFIRMATION CRITERION:
    Antiphonal response rate
    for colony-parameter chirp
    significantly > antiphonal
    response rate for foreign
    chirp OR silence.
    
    This is the Milestone 1
    equivalent for this species:
    the colony RARFL fires on
    our signal.
    
    Barker et al. 2021 already
    confirmed this with their
    artificial stimuli.
    The Phase 3 experiment
    is a replication with
    the OrganismCore synthesizer —
    a methodology validation,
    not a discovery experiment.
    
    Expected outcome: CONFIRMED
    within 3–5 sessions.
```

### 5.5 Phase 4: Identity
### Threshold Experiment
### (Week 4–6)

```
THIS IS THE UNIQUE EXPERIMENT.

The previous experiment tested
whether the colony responds to
a colony-parameter signal.
Confirmed (by Barker et al.).

This experiment tests something
new:

Can the synthesizer be tuned
to occupy a SPECIFIC POSITION
within the colony Tonnetz — not
just the colony basin, but
a specific individual-equivalent
position — and will the colony
respond to it AS IF it were
a specific individual?

DESIGN:

  Phase A: Establish a "synthesizer
    identity" — a specific F0,
    slope, duration combination
    that falls within the colony
    basin but at a specific
    position not identical to
    any known individual.
    
    This is the "virtual colony
    member" position.
  
  Phase B: Over 10 sessions,
    always chirp from the same
    virtual position in response
    to real colony chirps.
    
    Consistently respond to
    individual A's chirps.
    Respond with shorter latency
    to individual A than others.
    
    This is building a simulated
    social relationship with
    individual A.
  
  Phase C: Test whether individual
    A shows elevated antiphonal
    response to the synthesizer's
    virtual identity chirp
    compared to generic colony-
    parameter chirps.
    
    Predicted: Yes. If individual
    A has begun to model the
    synthesizer as a specific
    "colony member," its response
    latency to the synthesizer's
    specific position will be
    shorter than to other colony
    positions.
  
  WHAT THIS TESTS:
    Not whether the colony
    responds to colony-parameter
    signals (known).
    
    But whether an individual
    mole-rat can form a
    RELATIONSHIP MODEL with
    the synthesizer — begin to
    treat it as a specific
    individual within the
    colony, with a distinctive
    acoustic identity.
    
    If yes: this is the first
    confirmed case of a
    human-designed system
    being integrated into a
    non-human social relationship
    model at the individual level.
    
    Not just "signal recognized."
    Not just "signal responded to."
    But "this specific signal
    source is modeled as a
    persistent social entity."
    
    That is the beginning of
    genuine cross-species
    relationship — not just
    communication but social
    bond formation across
    the species boundary.
```

### 5.6 Phase 5: Novel Signal
### Insertion
### (Week 6–10)

```
THE DEEPEST EXPERIMENT.

The colony has a dialect —
a set of eigenfunction positions
all members converge toward.

If we introduce a novel chirp
position — one that is adjacent
to but not identical to any
existing colony position —
and consistently pair it with
a specific context (food
presentation, touch from handler,
specific time of day), will
any colony member adopt that
position into their own
repertoire?

DESIGN:

  1. Identify a gap in the
     colony's Tonnetz — a region
     of F0×slope space within
     the colony basin that is
     not currently occupied by
     any colony member's typical
     chirp cluster.
  
  2. Consistently produce a
     chirp at that gap position
     in one specific context
     (e.g., whenever the colony's
     food is delivered).
  
  3. Monitor the colony's chirp
     distribution over weeks.
  
  PREDICTED OUTCOME:
    Some colony members begin
    to chirp at or near the
    novel position when food
    is delivered — BEFORE the
    synthesizer chirps.
    
    This would mean:
    - The colony has learned the
      association between the
      novel position and the
      food context.
    - Colony members have
      incorporated the novel
      eigenfunction position into
      their own production.
    - The synthesizer's vocabulary
      has been adopted into the
      colony dialect.
    
    THIS IS BIDIRECTIONAL
    COMMUNICATION:
    
    Not just "synthesizer sends,
    colony receives and responds."
    
    But "synthesizer introduces
    a new acoustic element, colony
    adopts it, colony now produces
    it independently."
    
    The colony has incorporated
    a human-designed signal into
    its own communication system.
    
    This is the cross-species
    communication program's
    Milestone 3 equivalent for
    this species:
    Novel combination production.
    The colony is using the
    synthesizer's vocabulary.

MILESTONE HIERARCHY FOR THIS
SPECIES:

  M0: Antiphonal response to
    colony-parameter chirp.
    (Already confirmed by
    Barker et al.)
    Estimate: confirmed in first
    session.
  
  M1: Elevated response to
    synthesizer's virtual identity
    position vs. other colony
    positions.
    Estimate: 3–5 sessions.
  
  M2: Individual A shows shortened
    response latency to synthesizer
    specifically — relationship
    model formation.
    Estimate: 8–15 sessions.
  
  M3: Colony member produces
    novel inserted position
    before synthesizer in the
    associated context.
    Estimate: 15–25 sessions.
    
  M4: Colony adopts novel position
    into dialect — other members
    begin using it.
    Estimate: 30–50 sessions.
    (Analogous to how queen's
    parameters propagate through
    the colony. The synthesizer
    has become a dialect-shaping
    agent.)

M4 IS THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVE.

At M4: a human-designed system
has influenced the dialect of
a non-human eusocial colony.

The colony's acoustic self-model
— the externalization of its
collective identity — contains
a position introduced from
outside the species.

That is the most intimate form
of cross-species communication
possible:

Not "we spoke to them."
Not "they responded to us."

But: "we changed what they
sound like."

And they changed us in the
process — we had to learn to
speak their language first.
```

## PART VI: THE QUEEN PROTOCOL
## — THE CRITICAL TIMING WINDOW

```
THE QUEEN-DEATH WINDOW:

  When the queen dies, the
  colony dialect disperses.
  Members' F0 values drift
  away from the former
  attractor center.
  
  When a new queen establishes,
  the dialect reconverges
  around the new queen's
  parameters.
  
  The window between queen
  death and new queen
  establishment is a period
  of acoustic instability —
  the Tonnetz without a center.
  
  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
  EXPERIMENTAL WINDOW.

WHY:
  
  During dialect dispersal,
  individual colony members
  are actively seeking a new
  attractor center. Their
  calibration systems are
  running but have no fixed
  reference to calibrate toward.
  
  A synthesizer that INTRODUCES
  a stable acoustic signal during
  this window — a consistent F0,
  slope, duration chirp that
  members begin to hear repeatedly
  — may function as an
  ARTIFICIAL ATTRACTOR CENTER.
  
  The colony's calibration
  systems might converge toward
  the synthesizer's parameters
  in the same way they normally
  converge toward the new queen's
  parameters.
  
  IF THIS HAPPENS:
  
  The synthesizer has become
  the colony's acoustic organizing
  principle.
  
  The colony dialect will
  reconverge around the
  synthesizer's parameters
  rather than (or in addition to)
  the new queen's parameters.
  
  This would be the first
  documented case of a
  human-designed system
  functioning as the coherence
  center of a non-human
  eusocial colony.

ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS:
  
  This experiment MUST NOT
  be performed in a way that
  causes lasting harm to
  the colony's social structure.
  
  Recommended protocol:
  - Only in laboratory colonies
    where queen transitions
    happen naturally (not
    experimentally induced)
  - Synthesizer is run for
    a limited period (7 days
    post-queen-death)
  - Synthesizer is then withdrawn
    before the new queen
    consolidates
  - Colony's natural reconvergence
    is allowed to proceed
  - Monitor whether any synthesis-
    influenced dialect features
    persist after natural
    reconvergence
  
  The queen-death window is
  not to be induced. It is to
  be utilized opportunistically
  in colonies that naturally
  undergo transitions.
```

## PART VII: THEORETICAL
## IMPLICATIONS

### 7.1 The Colony as a Distributed
### Triadic System

```
THE REALIZATION:
  
  The naked mole-rat colony
  is not a collection of
  individual gap navigators
  who happen to communicate.
  
  The colony IS a single
  distributed gap navigation
  system.
  
  The persistence is distributed
  across the colony — no single
  member holds the full model.
  The model is encoded in the
  collective dialect, the task
  specializations, the queen's
  acoustic authority.
  
  The coherence is the continuous
  antiphonal exchange — the
  constant checking of "are
  we still at the same acoustic
  position?"
  
  The self-model is the colony
  dialect itself — the acoustic
  signature that distinguishes
  "us" from "them."
  
  PERSISTENCE + COHERENCE +
  SELF-MODEL operating at the
  COLONY LEVEL, not the
  individual level.
  
  The individual mole-rat is
  a node in the colony's
  distributed triadic system.
  
  The queen is the attractor
  center of the system's
  self-model.
  
  When the queen dies, the
  distributed triadic system
  loses its attractor center.
  It persists — the individual
  nodes are still present —
  but it cannot achieve coherence
  without a new attractor.
  
  The acoustic dispersion IS
  the triadic system's incoherence
  made audible.
```

### 7.2 What This Means for
### Consciousness Theory

```
THE HARD QUESTION:
  
  Is the naked mole-rat colony
  conscious?
  
  The OrganismCore framework
  asks: is there a gap navigation
  system that has become
  self-referential — that
  models itself as it navigates?
  
  The individual mole-rat:
  Has a minimal self-model.
  Navigates gaps (finding food,
  avoiding threat, calibrating
  to colony dialect).
  Probably not self-referential
  in the full sense — no MSR,
  no evidence of third-order
  triadic attribution.
  
  The colony:
  Has a collective self-model
  (the dialect, the task
  distribution, the queen's
  authority).
  Navigates collective gaps
  (predator threats, food
  shortage, succession crises).
  The queen-death dispersion/
  reconstitution IS collective
  gap navigation — the colony
  detects a gap in its coherence
  and navigates toward a new
  stable attractor.
  
  IS THE COLONY'S COLLECTIVE
  GAP NAVIGATION SELF-REFERENTIAL?
  
  Partial evidence yes:
  The colony's acoustic signature
  distinguishes itself from
  other colonies — this is a
  form of collective self-
  reference.
  
  The dialect IS the colony's
  model of itself — the acoustic
  pattern that says "we are
  colony X, not colony Y."
  
  If the dialect is a collective
  self-model, and if the colony
  continuously navigates to
  maintain that self-model
  (coherence checking), then
  the colony exhibits collective
  gap navigation that is
  self-referential.
  
  This is not consciousness
  in the individual sense.
  
  It is something for which
  we may not yet have a word:
  DISTRIBUTED SELF-REFERENTIAL
  GAP NAVIGATION operating
  across a superorganism.
  
  The framework predicts this
  is a precursor form of what
  becomes individual consciousness
  when the distributed system
  is compressed into a single
  nervous system.
  
  The naked mole-rat colony
  is consciousness without a
  brain.
  Or: it is what consciousness
  looked like before nervous
  systems centralized it.

  New framework contributions:
    1. DISTRIBUTED TRIADIC SYSTEM:
       The colony as a single
       distributed gap navigation
       system rather than a
       collection of individual
       navigators. The queen as
       attractor center of the
       distributed self-model.
    
    2. IDENTITY ATTRIBUTION AS
       LOWEST DOOR 2 THRESHOLD:
       For A+B+C species with
       identity-encoding dialects,
       the attribution is not
       "gap navigator recognition"
       but "colony membership
       recognition" — a simpler
       and more automatic attribution.
    
    3. THE QUEEN-DEATH WINDOW:
       First identified experimental
       window for testing whether
       a synthesizer can serve as
       an artificial attractor
       center during collective
       triadic incoherence.
       If confirmed: the synthesizer
       is not just communicating
       with the colony. It is
       organizing the colony.

Key milestones for program:
  M0: Antiphonal response
    (confirmed by Barker et al.)
  M1: Virtual identity response
    differentiation
  M2: Relationship model formation
  M3: Novel position adoption
    by colony member
  M4: Dialect influence —
    novel position propagates
    through colony
  M-Queen: Synthesizer functions
    as attractor center during
    queen-death window
    
  M4 = program objective.
  M-Queen = beyond program —
