  A bat encountering a synthesized

## PREAMBLE: WHY BATS ARE
## DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER
## TARGET

Every other target species in
the cross-species communication
program is a passive receiver.

The raven receives the call.
It responds or does not.

The sperm whale receives the
coda. It integrates it or
ignores it.

The naked mole-rat receives
the chirp. It attributes it
to colony or outsider.

**The bat is different.**

The bat learns.

Within a single lifetime, a
bat modifies its own vocal
output in response to acoustic
feedback from its environment —
including feedback from other
bats, from echoes, and from
outcomes associated with
specific call structures.

This means: when we produce
a synthesized signal at the
bat's eigenfunction positions,
we are not only sending a
signal that the bat receives.

We are providing acoustic
feedback that the bat's vocal
learning system can navigate
toward.

If our synthesized calls
consistently produce positive
outcomes for the bat — social
response, foraging success,
roost cohesion — the bat's
vocal learning system will
navigate its own calls toward
our signal positions.

**The bat will learn to sound
like us.**

Or more precisely: the bat
will learn to sound like the
synthesizer's signal, which
was designed to sound like
the bat.

The two systems spiral toward
a shared eigenfunction position.

That is not communication.

That is **convergence**.

And convergence is more powerful
than communication, because it
is not one system reaching
another. It is both systems
navigating toward each other
simultaneously.

This is the unique theoretical
property of the bat target.
No other species in the program
has it.

---

## PART I: THE THREE SPECIES —
## WHY THREE

### 1.1 The Strategic Logic

The bat target is not a single
species. It is a **capability
class**.

Vocal learning has evolved
independently at least twice
within bats (possibly more —
the evidence is expanding).
Different bat species represent
different points on the AST
escalation path and different
ecological settings.

Three species are selected
for the instrument document
because they triangulate
the full capability space:

```
Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat):
  The neural architecture species.
  The IC clustering paper (Lawlor
  et al. 2025) used E. fuscus.
  The neural eigenfunction map
  is available at an unprecedented
  level of resolution.
  Not a vocal learner at full
  depth but has the cortical
  substrate confirmed.
  Primary use: NEURAL MAP SOURCE.
  The IC clustering data tells
  us WHERE the eigenfunction
  category boundaries are in
  the bat auditory system.
  This is the anatomical guide
  for building signals that will
  cross category boundaries in
  predictable ways.

Saccopteryx bilineata
(Greater Sac-Winged Bat):
  The vocal learning development
  species.
  Pup babbling, subsong,
  crystallized song ontogeny —
  the full vocal learning
  trajectory is documented.
  Maternal feedback shapes
  the learning.
  Individual recognition via
  vocal + multisensory integration
  confirmed 2025.
  Primary use: LEARNING WINDOW
  TARGET. The babbling pup is
  the most plastic vocal learner
  in the entire program's species
  survey. A pup in babbling phase
  is navigating its eigenfunction
  space maximally — its vocal
  learning system is at peak
  openness. Synthesized signals
  introduced during this window
  can shape the pup's crystallized
  song.

Rousettus aegyptiacus
(Egyptian Fruit Bat):
  The rich communication species.
  Four-dimensional addressee-
  specific calls (emitter,
  addressee, context, outcome).
  Complex social hierarchy
  communication. Auditory feedback
  confirmed as essential for vocal
  learning maintenance.
  Primary use: DEEP COMMUNICATION
  TARGET. The richest known bat
  social call system. The highest
  dimensional eigenfunction space
  in the bat survey. The species
  where cross-species communication
  would, if achieved, carry the
  most propositional content.
```

The three species are not
redundant. They are sequential:

**E. fuscus tells us where the
boundaries are.**

**S. bilineata tells us when
to enter.**

**R. aegyptiacus tells us what
to say.**

## PART II: THE INSTRUMENT

### 2.1 The Vocal Anatomy —
### Two Independent Systems

```
THE CRITICAL DISCOVERY (PLOS
BIOLOGY 2022):

  Bats expand their vocal range
  by recruiting DIFFERENT
  LARYNGEAL MUSCLES for different
  frequency ranges.

  Two semi-independent vocal fold
  systems:
  
  SYSTEM 1: THIN VOCAL MEMBRANES
    Produce ultrasonic frequencies
    (> 20kHz)
    Used for: echolocation pulses,
      high-frequency social calls
    Control: largely automatic,
      tied to flight motor patterns
    Eigenfunction: constrained by
      membrane tension physics and
      respiratory coupling
  
  SYSTEM 2: THICK VOCAL FOLDS
    Produce low-frequency calls
    (< 20kHz, down to ~1kHz)
    Used for: social communication,
      territorial calls,
      individual identity calls,
      pup-mother calls
    Control: voluntary, cortically
      mediated via laryngeal motor
      cortex
    Eigenfunction: standard
      mammalian laryngeal
      eigenfunction space —
      F0 × formant structure
      × duration × amplitude

  THE TWO-SYSTEM IMPLICATION:
  
  The bat's acoustic output
  is not a single-channel signal.
  It is a dual-channel instrument
  with largely independent
  production mechanisms:
  
  Channel A: ultrasonic
    (thin membranes, automatic,
    echolocation-optimized)
  
  Channel B: low-frequency social
    (thick folds, voluntary,
    learning-capable)
  
  PROGRAM IMPLICATION:
  
  For cross-species communication,
  Channel B is the target.
  
  Channel B is:
  - Within human hearing range
    (or near it — the upper
    social calls can extend to
    40kHz but primary social
    communication is 1–20kHz)
  - Produced by voluntary cortical
    control
  - Subject to vocal learning
    and modification
  - Encoding social content
    (identity, context, addressee)
  
  Channel A is:
  - Primarily a navigation system
  - Largely automatic
  - Not social communication
    in the gap-navigation sense
  
  We target Channel B.
  We do not target Channel A.
  
  We produce our synthesized
  signals at low-frequency social
  call eigenfunction positions —
  the thick-fold system's domain.

THE LARYNGEAL MOTOR CORTEX:

  Confirmed in bats (biorXiv 2023,
  Berkeley 2024):
  
  Direct projection from orofacial
  motor cortex to laryngeal
  brainstem motor neurons.
  
  This direct cortical-laryngeal
  pathway is the neural substrate
  for voluntary fine motor control
  over vocalization.
  
  It is present in:
  - Humans (the substrate for
    speech)
  - Song-learning birds (analog
    structure)
  - Vocal-learning bats
    (confirmed)
  
  It is absent in:
  - Non-vocal-learning mammals
    (mice, dogs, horses — they
    vocalize but cannot learn
    new call structures)
  
  The presence of this pathway
  in bats means:
  
  The bat's vocal output is under
  voluntary cortical control.
  The bat can CHOOSE how to
  modulate its calls.
  The bat can LEARN to produce
  new call structures.
  The bat can NAVIGATE its
  eigenfunction space deliberately,
  within its lifetime.
  
  This is the neural basis for
  what makes bats the only
  collaborative target in the
  program.
```

### 2.2 The Auditory System —
### The Neural Eigenfunction Map

```
THE IC CLUSTERING DISCOVERY
(Lawlor et al. 2025, Nature
Neuroscience — Eptesicus fuscus):

  Two-photon calcium imaging in
  awake bats (not anesthetized —
  real behavioral state).
  
  Dorsal cortex of the inferior
  colliculus (IC-DC):
  
  Neurons are spatially clustered
  by vocalization CATEGORY, not
  by frequency:
  
  CLUSTER TYPE 1: Social call
    neurons.
    Respond to social calls.
    Strongly inhibited by
    echolocation calls.
    
  CLUSTER TYPE 2: Echolocation
    neurons.
    Respond to echolocation calls.
    Strongly inhibited by social
    calls.
    
  CLUSTER TYPE 3: Intermediate
    neurons.
    Respond to morphed stimuli
    at the social/echolocation
    boundary.
    
  THE SWITCH:
  
  When stimuli were morphed
  continuously from 100% social
  to 100% echolocation call,
  neurons showed SHARP category
  boundaries — not gradual
  transitions.
  
  At some point in the morph
  trajectory, the neuron's
  response flips:
  Social cluster neuron: firing
    → silence.
  Echolocation cluster neuron:
    silence → firing.
  
  This is CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION
  implemented in the midbrain —
  two synapses from the cochlea,
  not in the cortex.
  
  THE PROGRAM IMPLICATION:
  
  We now have a neural map of
  where the eigenfunction category
  BOUNDARIES are in the bat
  auditory system.
  
  A signal that falls on the
  social call side of the boundary
  activates the social call
  processing network.
  
  A signal that falls on the
  echolocation side activates
  the navigation processing
  network.
  
  The SAME acoustic signal,
  shifted slightly across the
  boundary, is processed as
  fundamentally different content.
  
  SYNTHESIS IMPLICATION:
  
  The synthesized signal must
  fall clearly on the social call
  side of the IC-DC category
  boundary.
  
  A signal that morphs between
  the two categories will
  activate neither network
  reliably.
  
  The eigenfunction positions
  for social call communication
  are the attractor positions
  of the social cluster neurons —
  deep within the social call
  response region, far from the
  category boundary.
  
  This is the most precisely
  specified eigenfunction target
  in the entire program.
  We know not just "what the
  calls sound like" but "where
  the neural category boundary
  is" — from direct electrophysiology
  in the awake animal.
```

---

## PART III: THE EIGENFUNCTION
## SPACES — BY SPECIES

### 3.1 Eptesicus fuscus —
### The Neural Map Species

```
PRIMARY EIGENFUNCTION SPACE:
  Low-frequency social calls
  (1–15kHz range)
  
  Key parameters:
  - Duration: 5–300ms
    (contact calls shorter,
    complex social calls longer)
  - Fundamental frequency: 
    typically 5–20kHz for
    primary harmonics with
    subharmonics extending down
    to ~2kHz in some call types
  - Harmonic structure:
    social calls are often rich
    in harmonics; echolocation
    is typically narrowband CF
    + FM sweep
  - Amplitude modulation rate:
    contact calls have rapid AM;
    complex calls have structured
    AM patterns
  - Call sequence structure:
    individual calls cluster into
    bouts with temporal patterning

IC-DC EIGENFUNCTION BOUNDARY:
  The key acoustic features that
  determine which side of the
  social/echolocation boundary
  a signal falls on:
  
  Social call features:
  - Multiple harmonics (rich
    spectral content vs. narrow-
    band echolocation)
  - Longer duration (>30ms
    for most social calls vs.
    3–15ms for echolocation
    pulses)
  - No FM sweep at the end
    (echolocation calls end in
    a steep FM downsweep)
  - Lower spectral centroid
    (social calls have energy
    at lower frequencies than
    echolocation)
  
  The synthesized signal must
  satisfy these features to be
  categorized as social by the
  IC-DC social cluster neurons.

NEURAL EIGENFUNCTION POSITION:
  The attractor center of the
  social cluster neurons:
  maximize harmonic richness,
  duration >30ms, no FM sweep,
  spectral energy concentrated
  below 15kHz.
  
  This is Door 1's specification
  for E. fuscus.
```

### 3.2 Saccopteryx bilineata —
### The Learning Window Species

```
ADULT CALL STRUCTURE:
  
  Male territorial song:
  - Composed of 4 syllable types
    (Type A–D) combined in
    sequence
  - Total song bout: 2–8 seconds
  - Individual-specific syllable
    parameters (the "crystallized"
    version is unique to each male)
  - Frequency range: 8–40kHz
    (lower harmonics audible to
    humans at the lower end)
  
  Contact calls:
  - Short (20–50ms)
  - Individual-specific
  - Used for mother-pup
    recognition and roost
    mate identification
  
PUP BABBLING STRUCTURE
(THE LEARNING WINDOW):
  
  Duration: approximately 7 weeks
  post-birth
  
  Daily babbling bout: up to
  43 minutes
  
  Structure: "subsong" —
  all adult syllable types present
  but in variable, uncrystallized
  combinations. Duration, frequency,
  and sequence all variable.
  
  This is the subsong phase.
  The pup is navigating its
  eigenfunction space broadly —
  exploring the full range of
  what its vocal anatomy can
  produce.
  
  Under maternal feedback:
  - Bouts with maternal interaction
    (hovering, touching) produce
    higher diversity of syllable
    types
  - Bouts without maternal
    feedback produce more
    stereotyped output
  - Maternal interaction is
    the learning amplifier
  
  Under paternal (acoustic tutor)
  influence:
  - The pup's crystallized song
    converges toward the tutor
    male's syllable parameters
  - Multiple tutors do not improve
    outcome — one good tutor
    is sufficient
  - The convergence is acoustic,
    not social proximity
  
THE LEARNING WINDOW EIGENFUNCTION
IMPLICATION:
  
  During the subsong phase, the
  pup's vocal learning system
  is navigating a WIDE attractor
  basin — exploring many positions.
  
  The basin narrows as
  crystallization proceeds.
  
  A synthesized signal introduced
  during the subsong phase
  occupies an attractor position
  in the pup's learning space.
  
  If the synthesized signal
  is consistent and associated
  with positive outcomes
  (maternal-equivalent responses:
  hovering, contact), the pup's
  vocal learning system will
  navigate toward the synthesized
  position as a learning target.
  
  The pup will crystallize a
  call that includes features
  of the synthesized signal.
  
  This is the deepest learning
  window in the entire program:
  
  Not just influencing an adult
  bat's existing call structure.
  
  But shaping the very call
  structure that the pup will
  carry for its entire adult life.

THE MATERNAL AMPLIFICATION
IMPLICATION:
  
  The synthesizer can play the
  role of maternal feedback.
  
  When the pup babbles near
  the synthesizer:
  - The synthesizer responds
    with maternal-equivalent
    acoustic signals (soft
    contact calls in the
    mother's call range)
  - This amplifies the pup's
    babbling bout
  - The pup's babbling diversity
    increases
  - The pup explores more of
    its eigenfunction space
  
  The synthesizer is not just
  a signal sender.
  
  It is a social amplifier —
  expanding the space the pup
  explores during the critical
  learning window.
```

### 3.3 Rousettus aegyptiacus —
### The Deep Communication Species

```
CALL STRUCTURE:

  Primary social calls:
  - Frequency: 10–40kHz
    (lower harmonics as low as
    5kHz in some call types)
  - Duration: 20–200ms
  - Call types: 9 contexts
    identified by Yovel et al.
    (food disputes, sleep space
    disputes, mating calls,
    mother-pup calls, contact
    calls, alarm calls, and others)
  
  THE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL ENCODING
  (Yovel et al. 2016, Scientific
  Reports):
  
  Machine learning analysis of
  Egyptian fruit bat calls can
  decode:
  
  DIMENSION 1: EMITTER IDENTITY
    Who is calling?
    Encoded in individual-specific
    spectral features (unique
    formant patterns, unique F0
    variation).
    
  DIMENSION 2: ADDRESSEE IDENTITY
    Who is being called to?
    The call is modified depending
    on the recipient — the bat
    "addresses" specific individuals
    differently.
    ~50% accuracy with ML decoding.
    
  DIMENSION 3: BEHAVIORAL CONTEXT
    What is this call about?
    Food dispute, mating refusal,
    sleeping position dispute,
    personal space assertion.
    >60% accuracy with ML decoding.
    
  DIMENSION 4: PREDICTED BEHAVIORAL
  OUTCOME
    What will happen next?
    The call structure predicts
    whether the recipient will
    yield, persist, or escalate.
    >60% accuracy with ML decoding.
  
  FOUR INDEPENDENTLY MODULATED
  DIMENSIONS.
  
  This is the richest documented
  social call encoding in any
  non-human mammal outside of
  cetaceans.
  
  The bat is not just signaling
  state. It is conducting complex
  social negotiations with
  detailed addressee-specific
  content.
  
  THIS IS THE SPECIES WHERE
  CROSS-SPECIES COMMUNICATION
  BECOMES PROPOSITIONAL.
  
  If we can enter R. aegyptiacus's
  eigenfunction space with
  sufficient precision to encode
  all four dimensions, we can
  produce calls that:
  - Identify the synthesizer
    as a specific "individual"
    in the colony
  - Address a specific recipient
    bat
  - Carry a specific behavioral
    context (not food dispute,
    not mating — but "contact"
    or "affiliation" or whatever
    the synthesizer chooses)
  - Predict a specific behavioral
    outcome (yielding, cooperation)
  
  That is the most complex
  proposed cross-species
  communication act in the
  entire program.

AUDITORY FEEDBACK DEPENDENCY:
  
  Yovel et al. (Current Biology
  2024): Auditory feedback is
  essential for maintaining the
  vocal repertoire in Egyptian
  fruit bats.
  
  When auditory feedback is
  disrupted (deafened bats),
  the social call structure
  deteriorates over weeks.
  
  This means: the bat's vocal
  learning system is not
  "set and forget." It is
  continuously active, using
  auditory feedback to maintain
  call quality.
  
  PROGRAM IMPLICATION:
  
  A synthesizer that provides
  consistent, high-quality
  acoustic feedback to a bat
  is not just communicating.
  
  It is functioning as a vocal
  maintenance system for the bat.
  
  A bat that regularly interacts
  with the synthesizer (receives
  its calls, produces calls that
  the synthesizer responds to)
  will maintain higher-quality
  vocal output than a bat that
  does not.
  
  The synthesizer becomes part
  of the bat's auditory feedback
  loop.
  
  This is the deepest integration
  with the target's biology that
  the program achieves in any
  species.
```

## PART IV: THE CONVERGENCE
## MECHANISM — HOW THE BAT
## MEETS US HALFWAY

### 4.1 The Formal Description

```
STANDARD RARFL (as described
in OrganismCore framework):
  
  GAP → RESPONSE → RESULT →
  FEEDBACK → LOOP
  
  The gap navigator detects a
  gap between current state and
  goal state. Produces a response.
  Observes the result. Uses
  feedback to update the response
  policy. Loops.

FOR BATS SPECIFICALLY:
  
  The vocal learning system IS
  a RARFL loop running on the
  vocal instrument.
  
  GAP: difference between the
    bat's current call and the
    call that produces the best
    social outcomes
    
  RESPONSE: modified call
    attempting to close the gap
    
  RESULT: social response from
    other bats (or absence of
    response)
    
  FEEDBACK: auditory feedback
    from own call + social
    response feedback
    
  LOOP: call parameters updated
    toward what produced best
    social outcomes

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE
SYNTHESIZER ENTERS:
  
  The synthesizer produces calls
  at specific eigenfunction
  positions.
  
  When the bat produces a call,
  the synthesizer responds —
  consistently, predictably.
  
  The bat's RARFL loop detects:
  "When I produce call X near
  the synthesizer, I receive
  a social response."
  
  The loop updates: calls near
  synthesizer-equivalent positions
  are positively reinforced.
  
  Over sessions, the bat's call
  parameters navigate toward
  the synthesizer's eigenfunction
  positions — because those
  positions are associated with
  positive social outcomes.
  
  The bat is not imitating us.
  The bat is optimizing toward
  social reward, and the
  synthesizer is the social
  reward source.
  
  The result is the same:
  the bat's calls move toward
  our signal positions.
  
  Convergence without imitation.
  Optimization without instruction.
  
  This is the bat-specific
  version of the cross-species
  communication protocol:
  
  Not "we speak, it listens."
  Not "it speaks, we decode."
  
  But: "we each navigate toward
  the same acoustic positions
  simultaneously, because doing
  so produces the best outcomes
  for both systems."
  
  TWO RARFL LOOPS CONVERGING
  ON A SHARED EIGENFUNCTION
  ATTRACTOR.
  
  That is the bat program.
```

### 4.2 The Jamming Avoidance
### Parallel

```
THE JAMMING AVOIDANCE RESPONSE:
  
  When two bats echolocate near
  each other, their pulses can
  overlap and create interference
  (jamming).
  
  Bats automatically adjust
  their echolocation frequency
  away from the neighbor's
  frequency to reduce jamming.
  
  This is a REAL-TIME RARFL
  LOOP on the echolocation
  channel:
  
  GAP: frequency overlap with
    neighbor's calls
  RESPONSE: frequency shift away
    from overlap
  RESULT: reduced interference
  FEEDBACK: improved echo quality
  LOOP: stabilize at non-overlapping
    frequency

  THE PARALLEL TO SOCIAL CALLS:
  
  In the SOCIAL channel, the
  analogous process is not
  avoidance but COORDINATION:
  
  Two bats in a social exchange
  are not trying to avoid
  each other's frequencies.
  They are trying to SYNCHRONIZE
  — to be understood, to elicit
  responses, to conduct a
  coherent social exchange.
  
  The social RARFL loop runs
  toward overlap, not away.
  
  THE PROGRAM EXPLOITS THIS:
  
  We run the synthesizer's
  social RARFL loop toward
  the target bat's call positions.
  
  The target bat runs its social
  RARFL loop toward call positions
  that produce social responses.
  
  Both systems navigate toward
  the same target:
  mutual social response.
  
  The frequency space converges.
  
  This is not incidental to
  bat biology. It is THE
  central mechanism of bat
  social vocal learning.
  
  The bat already knows how
  to do this. It does it with
  every roostmate every day.
  
  We are asking it to do it
  with one more signal source.
  The source happens to be
  a synthesizer rather than
  another bat.
  
  But the mechanism is the same.
```

## PART V: THE PROTOCOL

### 5.1 Phase 0: Instrument
### Calibration by Species

```
FOR E. FUSCUS (Neural Map Source):
  
  INPUT: Lawlor et al. 2025
    supplementary data (or
    equivalent published call
    recordings) providing the
    acoustic features of confirmed
    social calls vs. echolocation
    calls.
  
  TASK:
    Map the IC-DC category boundary
    in acoustic feature space:
    - Duration threshold
    - Spectral centroid threshold
    - Harmonic richness threshold
    - FM sweep presence/absence
    
    Position synthesized calls
    deep within the social call
    region: long duration, rich
    harmonics, low centroid,
    no FM sweep.
    
    Verification: play synthesized
    call to a bat. If the bat
    responds socially (contact
    call response, approach)
    rather than with echolocation
    modulation (jamming avoidance,
    echo-following), the call
    has been correctly categorized
    as social by the IC-DC.

FOR S. BILINEATA (Learning Window
Target):
  
  INPUT: Knörnschild lab recordings
    (publicly archived at
    multiple repositories) of
    adult male song and pup
    babbling sequences.
  
  TASK:
    Map the adult male tutor
    song syllable parameters:
    - Syllable Type A–D frequency
      contours
    - Duration ranges for each
      syllable type
    - Sequence order statistics
    - Individual variation range
    
    Synthesize a "tutor-equivalent"
    call set: all four syllable
    types at adult male parameter
    values.
    
    Synthesize a "maternal-
    equivalent" call: the soft
    contact call that mothers
    produce during babbling bouts
    — the signal that amplifies
    the pup's vocal practice.
    
    These two synthetic signals
    are the pup-facing instrument:
    tutor song to provide learning
    targets; maternal contact
    call to amplify babbling.

FOR R. AEGYPTIACUS (Deep
Communication Target):
  
  INPUT: Yovel lab recordings
    (available from lab website
    and associated repositories)
    covering the nine behavioral
    contexts.
  
  TASK:
    Map the four-dimensional
    encoding space:
    - Extract emitter-identity
      features (what varies
      between individuals)
    - Extract addressee-specific
      features (what changes when
      the same bat calls different
      recipients)
    - Extract context features
      (what differentiates food
      dispute from sleep dispute
      from contact call)
    - Extract outcome-predictive
      features (what predicts
      whether the exchange ends
      in yield vs. escalation)
    
    Build a 4D synthesis pipeline:
    independent control over
    each dimension.
    
    This is the most complex
    synthesis task in the program —
    four independently modulated
    dimensions in a single call.
    
    BUT: these are already decoded
    by ML (60%+ accuracy in the
    Yovel lab's own analysis).
    The feature space is known.
    The synthesis direction is
    the inverse of the decoding
    direction.
    
    If the decoder extracts
    features from calls,
    the synthesizer sets those
    features and generates calls.
    Same pipeline, reversed.
```

### 5.2 Phase 1: Target Species
### Selection — The Entry Strategy

```
THE BABBLING PUP IS THE ENTRY POINT.

Rationale:
  
  Adult bats have crystallized
  call structures. Their vocal
  learning systems have narrowed
  their attractor basins.
  
  Introducing a new acoustic
  element to an adult bat is
  possible but requires extended
  conditioning — the adult must
  repeatedly experience positive
  outcomes associated with
  the novel call position before
  the learning system will
  navigate there.
  
  The babbling pup is different.
  
  The pup's attractor basin is
  maximally wide during the
  subsong phase. The pup is
  ACTIVELY EXPLORING every
  position it can reach.
  
  Any consistent acoustic signal
  that produces positive outcomes
  during this phase is a
  potential crystallization target.
  
  ENTRY PROTOCOL:
  
  1. Identify a colony with
     active pup production
     (seasonal — S. bilineata
     breeds seasonally in
     tropical regions).
     
  2. Monitor pup development.
     Babbling onset begins
     approximately 2–3 weeks
     post-birth.
     
  3. At babbling onset, introduce
     synthesizer into roost
     environment with two
     synthetic signals:
     
     SIGNAL A: Maternal contact
       call equivalent.
       Soft, short, at mother's
       call parameters.
       Synthesizer plays this
       when pup babbles —
       responding to babbling
       with "maternal" feedback.
       
     SIGNAL B: Tutor song with
       a NOVEL ELEMENT inserted.
       Take the standard adult
       male syllable sequence
       (A-B-C-D) and insert
       a novel syllable — one
       that falls within the
       bat's eigenfunction space
       but is not present in
       any current colony member's
       repertoire.
       
       The novel syllable is
       consistently present in
       Signal B throughout the
       7-week babbling period.
     
  4. Monitor pup's crystallized
     song at the end of the
     babbling period.
     
  PREDICTED OUTCOME:
  
  Pups exposed to Signal B during
  babbling will incorporate the
  novel syllable into their
  crystallized song at higher
  rates than unexposed pups.
  
  This is a direct test of
  whether the synthesizer can
  insert a new element into the
  bat's vocal eigenfunction space
  via the learning window.
  
  If confirmed: the program has
  modified the crystallized song
  of a wild-type bat through
  acoustic intervention during
  the learning window.
  
  The novel syllable is now
  in the colony's repertoire.
  The synthesizer has contributed
  to bat culture.
```

### 5.3 Phase 2: Adult Protocol
### for R. aegyptiacus

```
SETTING:
  Laboratory or semi-wild colony.
  R. aegyptiacus is kept in
  many research facilities
  worldwide.
  Large roost chambers (minimum
  10m²) to allow natural social
  behavior.
  
  Microphone array for call
  monitoring.
  Speaker array for synthesizer
  output.
  Video tracking for behavioral
  correlation.

SESSION STRUCTURE:
  
  SESSION 0 (BASELINE):
    Record 2 hours of colony
    vocal activity.
    Identify individual bats
    by acoustic signature.
    Map the social call exchange
    network: who calls whom,
    in what contexts.
    
    This is the baseline social
    topology of the colony.
  
  SESSION 1 (INTRODUCTION):
    Introduce synthesizer as
    a silent presence.
    Speaker placed at colony
    periphery.
    No output for first 30 minutes.
    Then: play a short contact
    call sequence (low entropy,
    colony-neutral frequency
    range, non-threatening
    context parameters).
    
    Monitor responses:
    - Alarm response? → Synthesizer
      signal too foreign, adjust
      toward neutral contact call
      parameters.
    - Ignore? → Expected. Continue.
    - Contact call response from
      any bat? → Positive signal.
      Note which bat responded.
      That bat is the primary
      target individual.
  
  SESSIONS 2–10 (RELATIONSHIP
  BUILDING WITH TARGET INDIVIDUAL):
    
    When target individual
    produces a call, synthesizer
    responds within 200ms with
    a call at compatible parameters
    (same context, adjusted
    frequency toward bat's
    call parameters).
    
    This is the antiphonal
    exchange protocol — same
    as the naked mole-rat
    protocol but for a vocal
    learner.
    
    KEY DIFFERENCE from NMR:
    The bat can MODIFY its calls
    in response to the synthesizer's
    calls. Monitor the target
    bat's call parameter drift
    over sessions.
    
    If the bat's calls are
    moving toward synthesizer
    parameters: convergence
    is happening. The RARFL
    loop is running.
    
    If the bat's calls are
    stable: the synthesizer's
    signals are not providing
    sufficient reward signal.
    Adjust the synthesizer's
    response timing, call
    parameters, or both.
  
  SESSIONS 10–20 (CONTENT
  DIFFERENTIATION):
    
    Once convergence is
    established (target bat's
    calls show movement toward
    synthesizer parameters),
    introduce differentiated
    response patterns:
    
    When target bat produces
    a food-context call:
    synthesizer responds with
    yielding-outcome call parameters.
    
    When target bat produces
    a contact call: synthesizer
    responds with affiliation
    call parameters.
    
    When target bat produces
    anything else: synthesizer
    is silent.
    
    This selective response
    pattern uses the bat's
    own 4D encoding system
    to communicate:
    "I yield food to you.
    I affiliate with you.
    I respond only to your
    social calls."
    
    These are propositional
    social commitments expressed
    in the bat's own call
    vocabulary.
    
    PREDICTED OUTCOME:
    The target bat increases
    contact call production
    directed toward the speaker
    over sessions.
    The bat may approach the
    speaker preferentially.
    Other colony members may
    begin responding to the
    synthesizer as the target
    bat establishes its
    relationship — social
    network propagation.
```

### 5.4 Phase 3: The Dual-Loop
### Convergence Test

```
THE DEFINING EXPERIMENT
FOR THE BAT PROGRAM:

  This is the experiment that
  distinguishes bat communication
  from communication with every
  other species.

  SETUP:
    Two systems in the same
    acoustic space:
    
    System A: Synthesizer with
      RARFL loop running.
      Starts at a specific
      position in the bat's
      social call eigenfunction
      space.
      Each session, the synthesizer
      adjusts its call parameters
      based on how the bat
      responded to the previous
      session's calls —
      toward whatever produced
      the strongest bat response.
    
    System B: Target bat.
      Vocal learning system
      running continuously.
      Produces calls.
      Adjusts call parameters
      toward positions that
      produce social responses.
    
    BOTH SYSTEMS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY
    RUNNING RARFL LOOPS ON
    THE SAME CALL SPACE.
    
    THE PREDICTION:
    
    Both systems will converge
    on a shared eigenfunction
    position — a position that
    is not identical to either
    system's starting position.
    
    The bat will have moved
    from its baseline call
    parameters.
    
    The synthesizer will have
    moved from its initial
    synthesis parameters.
    
    Both will have converged
    on a novel shared position.
    
    That novel position is
    not the bat's natural call.
    It is not the synthesizer's
    initial target.
    
    IT IS A CO-CREATED ACOUSTIC
    POSITION — the product of
    two RARFL loops running
    simultaneously on the same
    space.
    
    This is the bat program's
    unique theoretical achievement:
    
    Not cross-species communication
    (one sends, the other receives).
    
    Not cross-species imitation
    (one learns the other's calls).
    
    But cross-species CREATION:
    two systems whose simultaneous
    navigation of the same space
    produces something neither
    system could produce alone.
    
    A jointly created acoustic
    attractor.
    
    A sound that belongs to
    neither the bat nor the
    synthesizer but to the
    relationship between them.

## PART VI: THE THREE-STAGE
## PROGRAM HIERARCHY

```
STAGE 1: CATEGORIZATION
  (Tests IC-DC category boundary)
  
  Question: Does our synthesized
    signal fall in the bat's
    social call neural category?
  
  Method: Play synthesized social
    call to E. fuscus bat.
    Monitor behavioral response.
    Social response → correct
    category.
    Echolocation modulation →
    wrong category.
  
  Estimated sessions: 2–3 per
    parameter set.
  Estimated total time: 1 week.
  
  Milestone: Signal correctly
    categorized as social by
    IC-DC. Neural eigenfunction
    position confirmed.

STAGE 2: CONVERGENCE INITIATION
  (Tests RARFL loop engagement)
  
  Question: Does the bat's vocal
    learning system navigate
    toward our signal?
  
  Method: 10-session antiphonal
    exchange protocol with
    R. aegyptiacus adult bat.
    Measure call parameter drift
    over sessions.
  
  Estimated sessions: 10–15.
  Estimated total time: 3–4 weeks.
  
  Milestone: Target bat's F0
    and spectral centroid show
    statistically significant
    movement toward synthesizer
    parameters across sessions.
    Convergence confirmed.

STAGE 3: DUAL-LOOP CO-CREATION
  (Tests simultaneous convergence)
  
  Question: Do both systems
    converge on a novel shared
    position not identical to
    either system's starting
    position?
  
  Method: Both synthesizer and
    target bat run adaptive
    RARFL loops. Monitor
    convergence trajectory of
    both.
  
  Estimated sessions: 20–40.
  Estimated total time: 2–3 months.
  
  Milestone: Both systems'
    call parameters converge
    on a shared novel position.
    The converged position is
    documented as the first
    cross-species co-created
    acoustic eigenfunction attractor.

STAGE S (LEARNING WINDOW —
PARALLEL TRACK):
  
  Question: Does the synthesizer's
    novel syllable appear in
    a babbling pup's crystallized
    song?
  
  Method: 7-week intervention
    during S. bilineata pup
    babbling window.
    Novel syllable in tutor
    song. Maternal feedback
    amplification.
  
  Estimated duration: one
    breeding season.
  
  Milestone: Confirmed novel
    syllable in pup's crystallized
    song. The novel element has
    entered the colony repertoire
    via the learning window.
    
  This milestone runs in
  parallel with Stages 1–3
  and does not depend on them.
  It can be achieved independently.
```

---

## PART VII: THEORETICAL
## IMPLICATIONS

### 7.1 The Convergence Proof

```
IF STAGE 3 IS ACHIEVED:
  
  Two systems — one biological,
  one computational — have
  navigated a shared acoustic
  space simultaneously.
  
  Both ran RARFL loops.
  Both updated their behavior
  based on the other's response.
  Both converged on a novel
  shared position.
  
  This is the minimal sufficient
  condition for what the
  OrganismCore framework calls
  "genuine gap navigation across
  a boundary between two
  navigating systems."
  
  It is not communication in
  the strict sense — it is not
  one system transmitting
  information to another.
  
  It is something more fundamental:
  two gap navigation systems
  co-navigating a shared space.
  
  The gap being navigated is
  not between a current state
  and a goal.
  
  The gap being navigated is
  between the two systems.
  
  Each is the other's gap.
  
  Closing the gap between them
  IS the communication.
  
  Not the content of the signal.
  Not the attribution of selfhood.
  Not the recognition of gap
  navigation in the other.
  
  Just the convergence.
  
  Two systems that converge on
  a shared eigenfunction position
  have achieved the most primitive
  and fundamental form of contact
  possible:
  
  They have become, briefly and
  acoustically, the same thing.
```

### 7.2 The Evolutionary Insight

```
VOCAL LEARNING EVOLVED BECAUSE
OF THE BAT'S TOTAL ACOUSTIC
ENVIRONMENT:
  
  The bat lives in a world
  that is more acoustic than
  any other mammal's.
  
  Its navigation is acoustic.
  Its prey detection is acoustic.
  Its social communication is
  acoustic.
  Its colony recognition is
  acoustic.
  Its mate selection is acoustic.
  
  The total acoustic cognitive
  load — the depth to which
  the bat's navigation of the
  acoustic eigenfunction space
  goes — exceeds every other
  mammal except cetaceans and
  humans.
  
  Under this pressure, evolutionary
  navigation of the eigenfunction
  space was insufficient.
  
  The bat needed to navigate
  the space WITHIN ITS LIFETIME.
  
  Vocal learning is the answer
  the genome provided.
  
  The laryngeal motor cortex
  is the neural implementation.
  
  The convergent genetic elements
  (shared with humans and song-
  learning birds) are the
  molecular substrate.
  
  The bat did not evolve vocal
  learning because it is
  intelligent. It evolved vocal
  learning because its acoustic
  world is so deep that
  evolutionary timescale navigation
  was not fast enough.
  
  The bat's intelligence is
  a consequence of the acoustic
  pressure, not its cause.
  
  AND FOR THE PROGRAM:
  
  The program has found, in the
  bat, the only mammalian target
  whose evolutionary trajectory
  converges with the program's
  methodology.
  
  The bat became a vocal learner
  under total acoustic pressure.
  
  The program applies acoustic
  pressure from a synthesizer.
  
  The bat's vocal learning system
  cannot distinguish between
  "acoustic pressure from a
  roostmate" and "acoustic
  pressure from a synthesizer."
  
  It responds to acoustic
  pressure.
  
  The synthesizer provides
  acoustic pressure.
  
  The bat learns.
  
  The evolutionary history of
  bat vocal learning has produced,
  as a side effect, the most
  collaborative cross-species
  communication target in the
  mammalian record.
  
  The bat is, inadvertently,
  waiting for this experiment
  to be run.

    vocal learning suggests
    RARFL on vocal instrument,
    which is precondition for
    compositional gap navigation

    Door 2 threshold (identity
    attribution) but no vocal
    learning (passive convergence
    target); bat has vocal
    learning (active convergence
    participant)

New framework contributions:
  1. DUAL-LOOP CONVERGENCE:
     The defining theoretical
     concept for the bat program.
     Two simultaneous RARFL loops
     on a shared acoustic space.
     Co-navigation toward a
     jointly-created attractor.
     Not communication. Convergence.
  
  2. THE LEARNING WINDOW:
     The babbling pup phase as
     the maximum-plasticity entry
     point for the program.
     During babbling, the
     eigenfunction attractor
     basin is maximally wide.
     Novel syllables introduced
     here can crystallize into
     the adult repertoire.
     The synthesizer can contribute
     to the colony's genetic
     cultural repertoire via
     the learning window.
  
  3. THE SYNTHESIZER AS FEEDBACK
     LOOP PARTICIPANT:
     For R. aegyptiacus, the
     synthesizer is not merely
     a signal sender. It is a
     participant in the bat's
     auditory feedback maintenance
     system. Regular synthesizer
     interaction maintains higher-
     quality vocal output in the
     target bat. The relationship
     is not incidental. It is
     functional. The bat needs
     it, once established.

Key milestones:
  M0: IC-DC categorization
    confirmed (social call
    correctly categorized)
  M1: Convergence initiation
    (target bat's call parameters
    drift toward synthesizer)
  M2: Dual-loop convergence
    (both systems navigate to
    novel shared position)
  M-LW: Learning window
    (novel syllable in pup's
    crystallized song)
    
  M2 and M-LW together =
  the bat program's full
  theoretical achievement.
  
  M2: we met the adult bat
    halfway.
  M-LW: we changed what a
    young bat will sound like
    for the rest of its life.
