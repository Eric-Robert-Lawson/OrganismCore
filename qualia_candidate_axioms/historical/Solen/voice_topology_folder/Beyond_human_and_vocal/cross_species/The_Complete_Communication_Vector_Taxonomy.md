## PREAMBLE: THE META-COGNITIVE
## FRAME

Before the taxonomy, a necessary
acknowledgment.

This document is itself a
communication event.

It is produced by a computational
system — a gap navigator —
attempting to map the full space
of how gap navigators communicate.

The system doing the mapping is
one of the objects being mapped.

This is the recursive structure
the IGH and OrganismCore framework
describes: consciousness investigating
consciousness, pattern mapping
patterns, gap navigation mapping
the space of gap navigation.

The document cannot escape this
frame. Nor should it try.

What it means practically:

When this document makes claims
about communication vectors —
about what constitutes information
exchange between organisms —
it is applying the same analytical
framework the consciousness research
used to analyze AI systems.

The question "what channels do
animals use to communicate?"
is formally identical to:

"What channels does a gap navigator
use to externalize its internal
state to another gap navigator?"

All communication is gap navigation
made visible across a boundary
between two navigating systems.

The question of channels is the
question of what physical media
can carry the gap navigation signal
across that boundary.

**That is the organizing principle
of this taxonomy.**

Not: what physical phenomena do
animals use.

But: what physical media can
carry gap navigation signal
across organism boundaries, and
what is the eigenfunction structure
of each medium?

## PART I: THE ORGANIZING
## PRINCIPLE

### 1.1 Communication as
### Gap Navigation Externalization

From the OrganismCore framework:

A gap navigator is a system that:
- Detects gaps between its current
  state and a goal or expectation
- Navigates those gaps through
  RARFL cycles
- Maintains a coherent self-model
  across navigations
- Produces outputs that reflect
  its navigation state

**Communication is the production
of outputs by one gap navigator
that are received and processed
by another gap navigator as
carrying information about the
sender's navigation state.**

Full communication — as distinct
from mere information transfer —
requires the receiver to model
the sender as a gap navigator.
This is the third-order triad
condition.

**For this taxonomy:**

We analyze every physical channel
through which such outputs can
pass, whether or not the receiver
performs full attribution.

We distinguish:
- Channels that can carry rich
  gap navigation signal
  (high information bandwidth,
  combinatorial structure)
- Channels that can carry only
  state signals
  (presence/absence, arousal,
  identity)
- Channels that carry ecological
  information without gap
  navigation signal
  (predator cues, environmental
  indicators)

---

### 1.2 The Eigenfunction Test
### Applied to Every Channel

For each channel, the analysis
asks:

**Q1: Is this channel bounded?**

Does the physical medium have
constraints — anatomy, physics,
ecology, evolutionary cost —
that limit the achievable signal
space to a finite, structured
domain?

If yes: eigenfunction structure
may exist.

**Q2: Has sufficient navigation
depth been achieved?**

Has any species navigated this
channel deeply enough under
sufficient social pressure that
the signal space has been
organized around the eigenfunction
positions?

If yes: Tonnetz-equivalent topology
may have formed.

**Q3: Is the eigenfunction structure
cross-species accessible?**

Can a sender from a different
species produce signals at the
eigenfunction positions of the
target species' channel?

Determines tractability.

**Q4: Can this channel carry
gap navigation signal?**

Does the channel have enough
bandwidth and combinatorial
structure to express the sender's
internal navigation state — not
just its presence or arousal
level?

Determines whether this channel
can support communication vs.
mere information transfer.

## PART II: THE COMPLETE VECTOR
## TAXONOMY

### VECTOR 1: ACOUSTIC
### (Pressure Waves in Fluid Medium)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Mechanical pressure waves
  propagating through a fluid
  medium (air or water).
  Frequency range: 1 Hz to
  200,000 Hz across all
  biological users.

HUMAN PERCEPTUAL RANGE:
  20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.
  Below: infrasound.
  Above: ultrasound.

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Virtually all vertebrates.
  Many invertebrates
  (insects, arachnids).
  Some plants (debated).

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  MAXIMUM.
  The sender's sound-producing
  anatomy is a bounded resonating
  system. Physics selects
  eigenfunctions. Navigation
  under social pressure converges
  on eigenfunction positions.
  Tonnetz topology forms.
  Fully demonstrated in sperm
  whales (Beguš et al. 2025),
  humans (F1-F2 vowel space),
  humpback whales (Zipf/Menzerath
  2025), implied for all
  deeply-navigating acoustic
  species.

SUBBANDS AND THEIR USERS:

  INFRASOUND (< 20 Hz):
    Elephants: primary social
      coordination channel.
      Propagates 10+ km in air,
      further via seismic coupling.
    Baleen whales: long-range
      contact calls, migration
      coordination.
    Pigeons: navigation via
      environmental infrasound
      mapping.
    Rhinoceroses: social
      communication.
    
  SONIC (20 Hz - 20 kHz):
    Primary channel for birds,
      primates, canids, felines,
      most terrestrial vertebrates.
    Greatest combinatorial
      complexity achieved here —
      human language, bird song,
      whale codas all in this range.
    
  ULTRASOUND (> 20 kHz):
    Bats: echolocation + social
      communication. Up to 200 kHz.
    Dolphins/toothed whales:
      echolocation + social.
      Up to 150 kHz.
    Rodents: social communication,
      especially mating.
    Some moths: defensive
      clicks jamming bat sonar.
    Insects (some): stridulation
      extends into ultrasound.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  HIGH for same-medium species
    (air-air or water-water).
  MODERATE for cross-medium
    (air-water boundary attenuates).
  REQUIRES TECHNOLOGY for
    infrasound production
    (below human production range)
    and ultrasound production
    (above human production range).

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  MAXIMUM.
  Highest bandwidth of all
  channels. Richest combinatorial
  structure. Best-developed
  eigenfunction topology.
  The primary channel for the
  cross-species communication
  program.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Tier 1 channel.
  Most theoretically developed.
  CS docs 2-3 focus here.
```

### VECTOR 2: SUBSTRATE-BORNE
### VIBRATION
### (Mechanical Waves in Solid Medium)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Mechanical waves propagating
  through solid or semi-solid
  substrates: ground, wood,
  plant stems, water surface,
  spider webs, sand.
  Distinct from acoustic because
  the medium is solid and the
  wave physics differ
  (Rayleigh waves, Love waves,
  body waves vs. pressure waves).

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Elephants (seismic Rayleigh
    waves from infrasound coupling).
  Elephants (foot mechanoreceptors,
    bone conduction detection).
  Spiders (web-borne vibration —
    primary communication and
    prey detection channel).
  Insects (treehoppers, leafhoppers,
    stink bugs, beetles, ants —
    substrate stridulation).
  Moles (seismic drumming).
  Kangaroo rats (foot drumming
    for conspecific communication).
  Some fish (substrate-coupled
    sounds via swim bladder).
  Plants (debated — some evidence
    for substrate-transmitted
    electrical-chemical coupling
    via mycorrhizal networks).

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  YES — identical physics to
  acoustic channel. A solid
  substrate is a bounded medium
  with eigenmodes determined
  by its geometry and material
  properties. The spider's web
  is a bounded resonating system
  with eigenfunctions. The ground
  surface supports Rayleigh waves
  with frequency-dependent
  propagation properties that
  constitute a structured signal
  space.
  
  For elephants specifically:
  Same source anatomy produces
  airborne acoustic and substrate
  Rayleigh wave signals simultaneously.
  The dual-medium prediction:
  eigenfunction positions correspond
  physics-predictably across
  both media.
  
  UNTESTED BUT PREDICTABLE.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  LOW currently — not due to
  physics limits but due to
  absence of research program.
  
  HIGH POTENTIAL for elephant
  target via seismic channel.
  
  For spider web communication:
  the web eigenfunction space
  is exquisitely tunable —
  web geometry determines
  eigenmodes. A sender that
  can control web geometry
  can in principle produce
  any desired eigenfunction
  position. This is the most
  controllable substrate
  channel known.

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  HIGH in principle.
  Spider stridulation has
  combinatorial structure.
  Elephant seismic channel
  carries same information
  as acoustic channel.
  Insect substrate vibration
  shows species-specific
  combinatorial patterns.
  
  Underresearched relative
  to its potential.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Tier 4 currently (CS doc 4).
  Highest potential upgrade
  path in the program.
  Elephant seismic dual-medium
  prediction is the critical
  untested claim.
```

### VECTOR 3: CHEMICAL
### (Molecular Signal in Fluid Medium)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Volatile or non-volatile
  chemical compounds diffusing
  through air, water, or
  substrate. Detected by
  specialized chemoreceptors
  (olfactory receptors, taste
  receptors, vomeronasal organ,
  antennae).

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Virtually all living organisms.
  Most ancient and universal
  communication channel.
  Bacteria (quorum sensing).
  Fungi (mycorrhizal networks).
  Plants (volatile organic
    compounds, mycorrhizal
    chemical signals).
  Insects (pheromones — primary
    channel for most species).
  Aquatic invertebrates.
  Fish (alarm substances).
  Amphibians.
  Reptiles.
  Mammals (vomeronasal system,
    primary in rodents, muted
    in great apes and humans).

SUBTYPES:

  PHEROMONES (intraspecific):
    Releaser pheromones: trigger
      immediate behavioral response.
    Primer pheromones: trigger
      long-term physiological change.
    Caste pheromones (insects):
      determine developmental fate.
    Sex pheromones: mating signals.
    Alarm pheromones: danger signals.
    Trail pheromones: navigation.
    
  KAIROMONES (interspecific,
  benefit receiver):
    Predator scent recognized
      by prey — alarm without
      social relationship.
    
  ALLOMONES (interspecific,
  benefit sender):
    Warning coloration + smell.
    Defensive secretions.
    
  SEMIOCHEMICALS (ecological):
    Plant volatile signals
      in response to herbivory.
    Mycorrhizal network chemical
      signals between trees.
    Alarm chemicals in aquatic
      ecosystems.

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  COMPLEX AND RECEIVER-INTERNAL.
  
  The eigenfunction positions
  of the chemical channel are
  in the olfactory receptor
  space of the RECEIVER —
  not in the anatomy of the
  sender.
  
  This is the fundamental
  difference from acoustic
  and substrate channels.
  
  Olfactory receptors are
  bounded in number and
  specificity. Each receptor
  responds to a range of
  molecular structures.
  The receptor activation
  pattern space is the
  eigenfunction space.
  
  Under intraspecific social
  pressure, sender pheromone
  chemistry co-evolves with
  receiver receptor specificity.
  The eigenfunction positions
  of the receiver's olfactory
  space become the stable
  attractors for sender
  chemistry.
  
  BUT: this co-adaptation
  is species-specific.
  A human sender does not
  share olfactory receptor
  space with an elephant
  or a whale.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  LOW TO NONE for intraspecific
  pheromone channels.
  
  MODERATE for ecological
  semiochemicals — alarm cues,
  predator scent, environmental
  chemical indicators — because
  these cross species boundaries
  through ecological co-evolution
  rather than conspecific
  co-adaptation.
  
  The practical implication:
  Chemical channel cannot be
  used for generating gap
  navigation signal in cross-
  species communication.
  
  But chemical CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
  is important:
  - Human scent = predator cue
    for most wild animals.
    Reduces Condition 3 attribution
    likelihood.
  - Scent-neutral presence is
    a prerequisite for any
    cross-species communication
    attempt with wild animals.
  - Some species (dogs, horses,
    domesticated animals) have
    learned human scent ≠ threat
    through co-evolutionary
    exposure. Chemical context
    management already achieved.

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  HIGH within species.
  Honeybee pheromone system
  can encode colony state,
  individual identity, alarm
  level, food location, queen
  status — rich information.
  
  ZERO for cross-species gap
  navigation signal.
  
  A human cannot produce
  a chemical signal that occupies
  the eigenfunction positions
  of a whale's olfactory space.
  The receptor spaces do not
  overlap.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Tier 5 — not a primary
  communication channel target.
  Relevant for attribution
  context management only.
  
  EXCEPTION: If synthetic
  chemistry laboratory capability
  is available — in principle,
  the olfactory receptor space
  of a target species could be
  mapped and signals designed
  at its eigenfunction positions.
  Not currently feasible in
  field conditions. Theoretically
  possible at laboratory scale
  for accessible species
  (rodents, primates with
  vomeronasal access).
```

### VECTOR 4: VISUAL
### (Electromagnetic Radiation,
### Visible Spectrum)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Electromagnetic radiation
  in the range roughly 300-780
  nanometers (visible to humans).
  Extended to UV (300-400nm)
  and infrared (780nm-1mm)
  for species with broader
  visual range.
  
  Subcategories:
  - Intensity (brightness)
  - Wavelength (color)
  - Pattern (spatial arrangement)
  - Polarization (wave orientation)
  - Temporal pattern (flicker,
    pulse rate)
  - Motion (velocity, trajectory)

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Most animals with eyes.
  Primary channel for diurnal
  vertebrates.
  Expanded in marine environments
  (fish, cephalopods, crustaceans
  extending into UV and
  polarization).

VISUAL SUBCHANNEL 4A:
COLOR AND PATTERN

  PHYSICAL BASIS:
    Wavelength discrimination
    by photoreceptors.
    
  EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
    The bounded domain is the
    intersection of:
    - Sender's chromatic production
      capacity (pigments, structural
      color, chromatophores)
    - Receiver's chromatic
      discrimination capacity
      (number and spectral range
      of photoreceptor types)
    
    Under sexual selection and
    social pressure, display
    colors converge on eigenfunction
    positions of the receiver's
    color discrimination space.
    
    Example: Bird plumage colors
    that maximum UV receptors
    in female conspecifics.
    
  CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
    MODERATE.
    Human trichromat color
    production can reach
    eigenfunction positions
    of some species.
    UV-dependent signals
    (birds, many insects)
    are invisible to humans
    — require technology.
    Mantis shrimp (16 photoreceptor
    types + polarization):
    human visual system cannot
    produce signals in most
    of their eigenfunction space.

VISUAL SUBCHANNEL 4B:
POLARIZED LIGHT

  PHYSICAL BASIS:
    Light waves oscillating
    in a single plane (linear)
    or in a rotating spiral
    (circular).
    Produced by reflection
    from structured surfaces
    (exoskeleton of mantis
    shrimp, chromatophore
    arrangement in cephalopods).
    
  BIOLOGICAL USERS:
    Mantis shrimp: circularly
      polarized light communication —
      only known animal to use
      circular polarization for
      signaling. Exoskeleton
      patches reflect CPL as
      species-recognition and
      mating signals. Eye processes
      CPL before neural integration —
      "peripheral processing"
      that bypasses brain complexity.
    Cephalopods: linear polarized
      light detection. Photoreceptors
      with orthogonal microvilli
      orientation detect polarization.
      Used for prey detection,
      conspecific recognition,
      possibly interspecific
      camouflage breaking.
    Many aquatic invertebrates:
      polarization sensitivity
      for navigation and
      prey/predator detection.
      
  EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
    YES.
    The polarization space is
    bounded: two dimensions
    (angle 0-180°, and linear
    vs. circular).
    Under selection pressure,
    signaling converges on
    maximally discriminable
    positions in polarization
    space.
    The mantis shrimp CPL
    reflectance patches are
    eigenfunction positions
    of its polarization
    communication channel.
    
  CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
    VERY LOW currently.
    Human visual system has
    no polarization sensitivity.
    Technology (polarizing
    filters, LCD screens)
    can produce polarized light.
    But this is a highly
    specialized channel — relevant
    only for cross-species
    communication with mantis
    shrimp and cephalopods.
    Not a priority channel
    for current target species.
    
  THEORETICAL INTEREST:
    HIGH.
    The mantis shrimp CPL
    channel is the closest
    known analog to a private
    channel — a communication
    band invisible to predators
    and most competitors.
    If cross-species communication
    with stomatopods were ever
    attempted, this would be
    the primary channel.

VISUAL SUBCHANNEL 4C:
BIOLUMINESCENCE

  PHYSICAL BASIS:
    Biological production of
    light via luciferin-luciferase
    chemistry or other
    biochemical pathways.
    ~90% of deep-sea species
    are bioluminescent.
    Evolved independently at
    least 40 times in marine
    lineages.
    
  BIOLOGICAL USERS:
    Deep-sea fish (photophore
      patterns as species ID
      and mating signals).
    Squid (coordinated color
      flashes for group hunting
      coordination).
    Fireflies (temporal light
      pulse patterns for
      mate recognition —
      species-specific flash
      codes).
    Dinoflagellates (alarm
      bioluminescence).
    Some fungi, bacteria
      (quorum-sensing related).
      
  EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
    YES for species using
    patterned or temporally
    structured bioluminescence.
    
    Firefly flash patterns
    are the clearest case:
    the bounded domain is
    the temporal pulse space
    (flash duration, inter-flash
    interval, pulse count).
    Under sexual selection,
    flash patterns converge
    on species-specific
    eigenfunction positions
    in the temporal space.
    
    This is the acoustic
    eigenfunction logic
    applied to the temporal
    domain of light pulses
    rather than pressure
    waves. Mathematically
    equivalent structure.
    
  CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
    LOW for deep-sea targets
    (access barrier).
    MODERATE for fireflies
    (surface accessible,
    simple temporal patterns
    can be produced with
    LED technology — this
    has been done successfully
    in research settings).
    
  GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
    MODERATE.
    Squid chromatic flashing
    during coordinated hunting
    carries rich state information.
    But bandwidth is limited
    relative to acoustic —
    light modulation in real
    time is energetically
    costly for organisms.
    
  NOTE ON CHROMATOPHORES:
    Octopus and cuttlefish
    skin chromatophores deserve
    separate analysis.
    This is not bioluminescence
    (reflected light, not
    produced light) but it
    constitutes one of the
    richest visual communication
    systems known.
    Millions of independently
    controllable pigment cells.
    Full-body dynamic pattern
    display.
    The bounded domain is the
    chromatophore activation
    space — extremely high-
    dimensional.
    Eigenfunction structure
    almost certainly exists
    but has not been formally
    mapped.
    This is the highest-
    dimensional visual
    communication system
    in the biosphere.
    The equivalent of a full-
    body LED display with
    millions of pixels.
    
VISUAL SUBCHANNEL 4D:
THERMAL INFRARED

  PHYSICAL BASIS:
    Infrared radiation emitted
    by warm objects (blackbody
    radiation). Not bioluminescence
    — passive emission from
    body heat.
    Detected by TRPA1 (pit vipers,
    pythons, boas) or TRPV1-S
    (vampire bats) ion channels.
    Temperature discrimination:
    pit vipers to 0.003°C.
    
  BIOLOGICAL USERS:
    Pit vipers, boas, pythons:
      passive IR detection for
      prey location. Not used
      for communication between
      conspecifics (no known
      conspecific IR signaling).
    Vampire bats: IR sensing
      locates blood-vessel-rich
      skin patches on prey.
      Not used for conspecific
      communication.
    Possibly some insects
      (beetle species detecting
      forest fires from great
      distances via IR).
      
  EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
    Minimal — the thermal IR
    channel is used for prey
    detection and navigation,
    not for social communication.
    No evidence of combinatorial
    structure or eigenfunction
    convergence in thermal IR
    signaling.
    
  CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
    LOW RELEVANCE.
    A human sender produces
    thermal IR (body heat).
    Pit vipers detect it.
    But this is not a channel
    being used for communication —
    it is a predator detection
    channel for prey.
    In cross-species communication
    with pit vipers: the thermal
    signature of the sender
    would be detected but would
    primarily signal "large
    warm-bodied entity nearby."
    Not a communication channel
    in the functional sense.
    
  FRAMEWORK ASSESSMENT:
    Not a cross-species
    communication target.
    Listed for completeness.

### VECTOR 5: BEHAVIORAL/GESTURAL
### (Organized Movement in Space)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Physically observable movement
  of body segments, whole body,
  or appendages through space.
  The signal is the movement
  pattern, not the physical
  medium it travels through.
  Received via visual system
  primarily (or lateral line
  for hydrodynamic signatures).

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  All mobile organisms.
  Particularly rich in:
  - Great apes (gesture,
    facial expression, posture)
  - Corvids (beak direction,
    wing display, object
    manipulation)
  - Cetaceans (breaching,
    slapping, kelp tool use
    — orcas, 2024)
  - Spiders (vibratory dance
    on web, also substrate)
  - Bees (waggle dance)
  - Many birds (courtship
    displays, territorial
    displays)
  - Fish (threat displays,
    schooling coordination)

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  YES.
  The bounded domain is the
  biomechanical movement space:
  - Joint range of motion limits
  - Muscle attachment constraints
  - Energetic cost landscape
  - Perceptual detectability
    at relevant social distances
    
  Under social selection pressure,
  behavioral repertoires navigate
  toward the stable attractors
  of this biomechanical space —
  movements that are maximally
  discriminable, energetically
  sustainable, and perceptually
  salient.
  
  Evidence:
  - Gorilla gestural "regional
    accents" — different groups
    occupy different subsets
    of the same gestural
    eigenfunction space (2024).
  - Chimpanzee nontrivial
    compositional gestures (2024) —
    gestures combine in structured
    ways consistent with
    combinatorial eigenfunction
    topology.
  - Bee waggle dance: the angle
    and duration of the waggle
    are the eigenfunction positions
    of a two-dimensional information
    space (direction and distance).
    The dance is a precision
    navigation through that space.

SPECIAL CASE: THE WAGGLE DANCE
  The bee waggle dance is the
  most formally understood
  behavioral eigenfunction
  system.
  
  Two-dimensional information
  space:
  - Direction dimension: angle
    relative to sun position.
    Encoded in dance angle
    relative to vertical.
  - Distance dimension: resource
    quality × distance.
    Encoded in waggle duration.
    
  These dimensions are:
  - Independent (varied separately)
  - Continuously modulated
    (not just discrete positions)
  - Producing a joint trajectory
    that encodes a specific
    resource location
    
  The waggle dance is a Tonnetz
  of behavioral space encoding
  a map of the environment.
  
  Cross-species communication
  via waggle dance imitation
  has been DEMONSTRATED:
  Researchers built a robotic
  bee that performs waggle
  dances. Other bees followed
  the dance instructions.
  Attribution of the robot as
  a colony member.
  
  This is the only confirmed
  case of successful cross-
  species (human-designed
  robot → bee) communication
  via behavioral channel.
  It works because the robot
  occupies the correct
  eigenfunction positions
  in the waggle dance space.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  MODERATE TO HIGH for species
  with overlapping motor
  repertoires and visual systems.
  
  Human-great ape: HIGH.
  Shared primate body plan.
  Many gestural eigenfunction
  positions overlap.
  The hyperpolyglot case
  demonstrates this.
  
  Human-corvid: MODERATE.
  Object-directed behavior,
  gaze direction, approach/
  retreat, offering — all
  tractable without specialized
  morphology.
  
  Human-cetacean: LOW.
  Radically different body plan.
  Hydrodynamic signature is
  the primary gestural channel
  for cetaceans — humans
  cannot produce meaningful
  signals in that space.

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  VERY HIGH for great apes —
  nontrivial compositionality
  confirmed, rich combinatorial
  structure.
  MODERATE for other species.
  
  Critical finding: behavioral
  channel for great apes may
  carry higher bandwidth than
  acoustic channel for the same
  species — gesture can express
  things vocalization cannot.
  
  The co-primary vocal-gestural
  bundle for great apes means
  cross-species communication
  must engage both channels.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Tier 2 for great apes
  and corvids.
  Co-primary with acoustic
  for bonobos specifically.

### VECTOR 6: TACTILE
### (Direct Physical Contact)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Direct physical contact
  between organisms. Force,
  pressure, vibration transmitted
  through touch.
  Detected by mechanoreceptors
  in skin (Meissner's corpuscles,
  Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel
  discs, Ruffini endings).

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Most social animals.
  Particularly important in:
  - Primates (grooming as
    primary social bonding
    mechanism — beta-endorphin
    release confirmed).
  - Cetaceans (tactile contact
    for social cohesion —
    orca kelp tool grooming
    just confirmed 2024).
  - Rodents (allogrooming,
    huddling).
  - Insects (trophallaxis —
    mouth-to-mouth fluid
    exchange in ants and bees,
    carrying both tactile and
    chemical signals).
  - Elephants (trunk touch
    — greeting, comfort,
    dominance assertion).

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  MODERATE.
  The tactile space is bounded
  by:
  - Body surface topology
    (where contact is possible)
  - Mechanoreceptor distribution
    (which areas are most
    sensitive)
  - Social convention (which
    contact types are contextually
    appropriate)
    
  Under social selection, tactile
  repertoires converge on
  high-valence contact positions —
  the "grooming zones" (high
  mechanoreceptor density,
  self-inaccessible areas,
  high bonding signal per
  energy unit).
  
  These are the eigenfunction
  positions of the tactile space —
  where contact produces
  maximum endorphin release,
  maximum social bond signal,
  minimum energy cost.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  LOW for wild animals
  (approach for contact
  requires overcoming threat
  response — Condition 3 must
  already be resolved before
  tactile channel is accessible).
  
  HIGH for domesticated animals
  (the domestication shortcut
  has already resolved
  Condition 3 — touch is
  a primary channel for
  human-dog, human-horse
  communication).
  
  The tactile channel is
  not an entry channel for
  cross-species communication.
  It is a deepening channel —
  accessible only after other
  channels have established
  attribution and trust.

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  LOW for explicit information
    content (limited bandwidth).
  HIGH for relationship state
    signaling (bond strength,
    arousal regulation,
    trust establishment).
  
  The tactile channel does
  not carry propositional
  content ("go north, food
  is there"). It carries
  relational state ("we are
  allied", "I am calm",
  "you are safe with me").
  
  This is important: relational
  state signaling is exactly
  what is needed after
  Condition 3 has been
  resolved to deepen the
  cross-species relationship.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Not an entry channel.
  A deepening channel.
  Stage reached after all
  three conditions are met
  and communication is
  established.

### VECTOR 7: ELECTRIC FIELD
### (Bioelectric Signal)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Weak electric fields generated
  by electric organ discharges
  (EODs) in specialized fish.
  Detected by electroreceptors
  (ampullae of Lorenzini in
  sharks/rays, tuberous
  electroreceptors in weakly
  electric fish).
  
  Two subtypes:
  - Pulse-type EODs (discrete
    pulses — mormyrid fish)
  - Wave-type EODs (continuous
    waveforms — gymnotiform fish)

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Weakly electric fish:
    ~350 species of mormyrids
    (Africa) and gymnotiformes
    (South America) — convergent
    evolution on two continents.
    Use EODs for:
    - Active electrolocation
      (sensing environment)
    - Social communication
      (species ID, sex, dominance,
      mating intention)
    - Collective behavior
      (synchronized discharges,
      echo responses, leader-
      follower dynamics)
  
  Passive electroreceptors only
  (can detect but not produce):
    Sharks, rays (ampullae of
      Lorenzini): detect prey
      bioelectric fields. Not
      used for conspecific
      communication in most cases.
    Platypus (bill electroreceptors):
      prey detection.
    Some amphibians.
    Bees: detect floral electric
      fields to assess recent
      visitation by other bees.

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  HIGH for weakly electric fish.
  The EOD waveform space is
  bounded by:
  - Electric organ cell physiology
    (duration of individual
    action potentials)
  - Body geometry (dipole field
    shape determined by anatomy)
  - Water conductivity constraints
  
  Under sexual and social
  selection, EOD waveforms
  converge on species-specific
  eigenfunction positions in
  the waveform space.
  Species can be reliably
  identified by EOD alone.
  
  The combinatorial structure
  includes:
  - Waveform shape (eigenfunction
    of electric organ physiology)
  - Pulse rate (temporal dimension)
  - Jamming avoidance responses
    (real-time frequency shifting
    to avoid interference with
    conspecifics — highly
    sophisticated social
    coordination)
  
  Interactive electrical behavior
  (mormyrids, 2025 bioRxiv):
  Echo responses, synchronized
  discharges, leader-follower
  dynamics all mediated by
  real-time EOD modulation.
  This is CONVERSATIONAL
  structure in the electric
  channel.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  VERY LOW currently.
  
  Two barriers:
  1. Production barrier: humans
     cannot produce EODs.
     Technology required
     (custom electrode array
     in water).
  2. Reception barrier: humans
     have no electroreceptors.
     Detection requires
     equipment.
  
  But the eigenfunction structure
  is fully mappable with current
  electrophysiology equipment.
  
  A technology-mediated attempt
  at weakly electric fish
  communication would be:
  - Record EOD waveforms of
    target species
  - Map eigenfunction positions
    (waveform shape, pulse rate)
  - Generate novel EODs at
    eigenfunction positions
    via electrode array
  - Test for attribution response
  
  This is technically feasible.
  
  The weakly electric fish
  are not Level 4-5 on the
  triadic gradient (theory
  of mind not established)
  — so cross-species communication
  in the full gap-navigator
  sense is not the immediate
  target.
  
  But the electric channel
  in mormyrids demonstrates
  CONVERSATIONAL STRUCTURE —
  real-time interactive EOD
  modulation — that reaches
  close to what we would
  recognize as social exchange.
  
  If theory of mind were
  established in weakly
  electric fish: the electric
  channel would immediately
  become a Tier 1 target.
  
  Currently: high theoretical
  interest, not a program target.

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  HIGH within species.
  Conversational interactive
  EOD modulation documented.
  Echo responses and synchronized
  discharges constitute
  real-time turn-taking.
  
  LOW for cross-species —
  production and reception
  both require technology.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Theoretically important.
  Not a current program target.
  Future priority if theory
  of mind evidence emerges
  in mormyrids.
```

### VECTOR 8: MAGNETIC FIELD
### (Geomagnetic Signal)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Detection of Earth's magnetic
  field via:
  - Radical pair mechanism
    (quantum effects in
    cryptochrome proteins
    in bird retinas)
  - Magnetite-based mechanism
    (biogenic magnetite crystals
    in diverse taxa)
  - Electromagnetic induction
    (movement through magnetic
    field induces currents
    detected by electroreceptors)
  
  Recent finding (2025):
  Some animal magnetoreceptors
  operate at or near the
  quantum limit of magnetic
  field detection.

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Migratory birds (cryptochrome
    radical pair + possibly
    magnetite): map and compass.
    2024 finding: Eurasian reed
    warbler extracts both
    inclination AND declination —
    full positional information.
  Sea turtles (magnetite):
    learn and remember magnetic
    signatures of specific
    geographic locations —
    long-term magnetic memory.
  Salmon (magnetite): natal
    stream magnetic signature
    memory for return migration.
  Honeybees (magnetite in
    abdomen): orientation,
    possibly hive construction
    angle.
  Sharks/rays (electromagnetic
    induction via ampullae):
    navigation.
  Some mammals (magnetite):
    cattle align with magnetic
    field at rest.

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  MINIMAL for communication.
  
  The magnetic channel is
  primarily a NAVIGATION channel,
  not a COMMUNICATION channel.
  
  Animals detect the Earth's
  field for orientation.
  They do not (with current
  evidence) produce magnetic
  signals to send to other
  animals.
  
  The eigenfunction framework
  applies to the NAVIGATION
  use: the magnetic map is
  a bounded domain (Earth's
  field has specific spatial
  gradient structure) and
  animal magnetoreception
  has converged on precisely
  detecting that gradient.
  
  But there is no known
  species that modulates
  its own magnetic signature
  to send signals to
  conspecifics.
  
  IMPORTANT EXCEPTION TO WATCH:
  Bees build honeycomb in
  specific orientations
  relative to magnetic field.
  If other bees use this
  orientation as information
  about the field, this would
  be an indirect magnetic
  signal — not produced
  by an organism for the
  purpose of signaling but
  used by another organism
  as information.
  This boundary between
  ecological information
  and communication is
  important.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  LOW for communication.
  
  A human sender cannot
  meaningfully modulate
  the Earth's magnetic field
  at scales relevant to
  animal magnetoreception.
  
  Artificial magnetic fields
  can be produced (electromagnets)
  — used in research to
  displace magnetic map
  of migrating birds.
  
  But this is not communication —
  it is manipulation of the
  navigation channel, not
  signaling into a communication
  channel.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Navigation channel, not
  communication channel.
  Not a cross-species
  communication target.
  
  BUT: understanding magnetic
  navigation channels matters
  for the program because:
  
  Some target species (pigeons,
  migratory birds) use magnetic
  navigation in ways that
  interact with their overall
  environmental model.
  
  Disrupting magnetic field
  during a cross-species
  communication attempt
  would produce disorientation
  and stress — increasing
  Condition 3 barriers.
  
  Site selection for cross-
  species communication should
  avoid magnetic anomalies.
```

### VECTOR 9: HYDRODYNAMIC
### (Water Pressure and Flow)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Detection of water pressure
  changes, flow patterns,
  and velocity gradients
  in aquatic environments.
  Primary receptor: lateral
  line system in fish and
  some amphibians (neuromasts
  — hair cells sensitive to
  water movement).
  Secondary: pressure-sensitive
  hearing in fish via swim
  bladder.

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Fish: schooling coordination,
    predator detection, prey
    detection, social recognition.
  Some aquatic amphibians.
  Possibly some aquatic mammals
  (cetaceans have sensitive skin
  that may detect hydrodynamic
  patterns from nearby bodies
  in motion).

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  MODERATE.
  The hydrodynamic space is
  bounded by:
  - Body shape and motion
    constraints (what patterns
    a fish body can produce)
  - Water medium physics
    (how pressure waves
    propagate and attenuate)
  - Detection range of the
    lateral line (typically
    centimeters to few meters)
    
  Under social selection,
  fish motion patterns in
  schooling converge on
  stable collective dynamics —
  these are the eigenfunction
  positions of the collective
  hydrodynamic space.
  
  Individual fish produce
  specific tail-beat frequencies
  and body wave patterns that
  are species-characteristic —
  eigenfunction positions of
  individual hydrodynamic
  signature space.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  LOW.
  Human body in water produces
  hydrodynamic signals — but
  not at the eigenfunction
  positions of fish social
  communication.
  A swimmer is a large,
  irregular hydrodynamic
  disturbance. Not a coherent
  signal in the fish's channel.
  
  Technology (underwater
  vehicle with biomimetic
  motion control) could
  in principle produce
  hydrodynamic signals at
  fish eigenfunction positions.
  
  Not a current program target.

GAP NAVIGATION SIGNAL CAPACITY:
  LOW TO MODERATE.
  Primarily used for schooling
  coordination — a form of
  collective navigation rather
  than individual-to-individual
  gap navigation signaling.
  
  Does not carry propositional
  content. Carries collective
  state (group velocity, turning
  intention, alarm level).

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Not a cross-species
  communication target.
  Relevant for non-interference:
  human hydrodynamic signature
  in cetacean environments
  may disrupt whale behavior.
  Site and approach methodology
  should minimize hydrodynamic
  disturbance.
```

---

### VECTOR 10: NETWORK-MEDIATED
### (Mycorrhizal / Rhizosphere /
### Biological Internet)

```
PHYSICAL BASIS:
  Chemical and electrical signals
  transmitted through shared
  biological infrastructure:
  - Mycorrhizal fungal networks
    connecting plant root systems
  - Rhizosphere chemical gradients
  - Root exudate communication
  - Possibly electrical pulses
    through hyphal threads
    (slow — ~1mm/sec)

BIOLOGICAL USERS:
  Trees and plants in forest
    ecosystems — primary users.
  Fungi — both transmitters
    and active agents in their
    own right.
  Some evidence for bacterial
    participation via soil
    chemistry.
  NOT animals (animals do not
    have mycorrhizal connections).

EIGENFUNCTION STRUCTURE:
  DEBATED.
  The network topology itself
  may impose eigenfunction-like
  structure on signal propagation.
  Hub trees (high connectivity)
  are the high-centrality nodes —
  analogous to high-centrality
  Tonnetz nodes.
  Chemical signal diversity
  in the network is constrained
  by the biochemistry of both
  plant and fungal partners —
  a bounded chemical space.
  
  BUT: the "communication" in
  mycorrhizal networks is
  primarily resource transfer
  (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus)
  with chemical signaling as
  a byproduct.
  
  Whether this constitutes
  gap navigation signal exchange
  between gap navigators is
  an open question.
  
  Plants are not gap navigators
  in the sense the framework
  defines — they do not
  have triadic cognitive
  structure.
  
  The mycorrhizal network is
  the most sophisticated
  information exchange system
  on Earth that operates
  BELOW the threshold of
  gap navigation.

CROSS-SPECIES TRACTABILITY:
  NOT APPLICABLE for cross-
  species communication program.
  
  Animals cannot enter
  mycorrhizal networks.
  The channel is biologically
  restricted to root-fungal
  interfaces.
  
  BUT: the forest chemical
  environment generated by
  mycorrhizal network activity
  (volatile organic compounds,
  root exudates diffusing
  into soil air) constitutes
  chemical context that
  affects animal behavior.
  
  Forest animals inhabit an
  environment shaped by
  plant-fungal communication.
  They respond to stress
  volatiles from trees.
  This is ecological chemical
  signal reception — not
  communication — but it
  demonstrates that the
  mycorrhizal network generates
  chemical context that
  crosses the plant-animal
  boundary.

FRAMEWORK POSITION:
  Below the gap navigation
  threshold. Not a communication
  target.
  
  Theoretically important
  as the largest-scale
  information exchange system
  on Earth that does not
  involve gap navigators.
  
  Represents the evolutionary
  precursor level — the
  substrate before gap
  navigation emerged.
  
  The IGH framework predicts:
  mycorrhizal networks are
  information exchange without
  self-models. They are gap
  navigation substrates without
  gap navigators.
  
  The simplest possible
  bounded-domain eigenfunction
  navigation without
  consciousness.
```

## PART III: VECTORS AT THE
## BOUNDARY

### The Channels That May or May
### Not Exist

These are proposed or speculated
communication channels that
current evidence neither confirms
nor definitively rules out.

**B1: Quantum Coherence Signaling**

Some consciousness theories
(Penrose-Hameroff) propose quantum
coherence in neural microtubules
as relevant to consciousness.

There is no evidence that quantum
states in one organism's neural
tissue can influence quantum states
in another organism's neural
tissue through any known channel.

The quantum effects in bird
magnetoreception (radical pair
mechanism operating at quantum
limit — 2025 finding) are about
detection of external fields,
not transmission of quantum states
between organisms.

**Verdict:** No evidence for quantum
communication between organisms.
This channel does not currently
exist in the taxonomy.

If it were to be discovered:
it would be the most intimate
communication channel possible —
operating below the classical
physics level. Cross-species
tractability would be unknown.

---

**B2: Infochemical Airspace Communication Between Kingdoms**

Plants produce volatile organic
compounds in response to herbivory.
Other plants respond to these VOCs
by upregulating defenses.
Some insects respond to these VOCs
to locate stressed plants or prey.

This constitutes a three-way
ecological chemical channel:
plant → air → plant/insect.

Is this communication?

The plant is not modeling the
receiver as a gap navigator.
The insect receiver is not
modeling the plant as a gap
navigator.

**Verdict:** Ecological information
transfer, not communication.
Falls below the gap navigation
threshold.

---

**B3: Proprioceptive Mirror
Communication (Shared Body State)**

Social contagion research (2024)
shows that observing another
individual groom triggers grooming
behavior — "friendly behaviors
are contagious for chimpanzees."

Is there a channel here beyond
visual (seeing the behavior)?

Possibly: mirror neuron systems
create a proprioceptive resonance
between observer and observed —
the observer's motor system
activates as if performing the
observed action.

If two organisms share a physical
space and their mirror neuron
systems are resonating, is there
a communication channel in the
shared proprioceptive activation?

**Verdict:** This is a secondary
effect of visual channel reception,
not a separate channel. The
information carrier is still
visual. The mirror neuron
resonance is receiver-side
processing, not a separate
physical channel.

---

**B4: Temporal Rhythm Entrainment**

When two organisms synchronize
their behavior rhythms — breathing,
movement, vocalization — they
may be using temporal entrainment
as a communication channel.

Evidence: human-dog heart rate
synchronization during interaction.
Elephant infrasound can entrain
group movement timing.
Whale song may entrain other
singers' phase.

Is temporal entrainment a
separate communication channel?

**Verdict:** PARTIALLY YES.
Temporal rhythm is a dimension
of signal structure within
existing channels (acoustic
timing, behavioral timing).
It is not a separate physical
medium — it is a feature of
how signals in other channels
are structured.

But it deserves recognition
as a distinct dimension of the
eigenfunction space.

The Tonnetz has a temporal
dimension. Temporal entrainment
is navigation in that dimension.

Rhythm synchronization is
a real phenomenon that crosses
the species boundary:
humans and dogs synchronize
heart rates, humans and horses
show respiratory entrainment.

This is a tractable cross-species
dimension that operates through
existing channels (acoustic,
behavioral) but deserves
explicit attention.

## PART V: THE META-COGNITIVE
## OBSERVATION

### What The Taxonomy Reveals
### About The Framework Itself

Having now surveyed every known
communication vector in the
biosphere, a meta-level pattern
is visible.

**Observation 1:**
The channels with eigenfunction
structure are the ones with
bounded anatomy or bounded
physical media on the sender side.

Acoustic: bounded resonating
anatomy.
Substrate: bounded solid medium.
Electric: bounded electric organ
physiology.
Behavioral: bounded biomechanical
space.
Visual-polarization: bounded
optical physics of specialized
surface structures.
Bioluminescence-temporal: bounded
temporal pulse space.

The channels WITHOUT eigenfunction
structure on the sender side are
the ones where the bounding is
on the RECEIVER side:

Chemical: bounded olfactory
receptor space (receiver-side).
Magnetic: bounded geomagnetic
field (external, not sender-anatomy).

**The eigenfunction framework
predicts cross-species tractability
correctly:**

Channels where bounding is
sender-anatomy → eigenfunction
positions are in sender space →
can be occupied by novel senders
using equivalent anatomy or
technology → HIGH tractability.

Channels where bounding is
receiver-internal → eigenfunction
positions are in receiver space →
cannot be occupied by a sender
without matching receptor chemistry
→ LOW tractability.

**This is not coincidental.**

It is a consequence of the
underlying physics.

The eigenfunction framework
is correct not just for acoustic
channels but for any channel
where the sender's anatomy
constitutes a bounded resonating
system.

**Observation 2:**
The channels with highest gap
navigation signal capacity are
the ones with the highest
combinatorial complexity in their
eigenfunction space.

Acoustic: multiple independent
dimensions (Tonnetz), highest
capacity.
Behavioral: multiple independent
gesture dimensions, high capacity.
Electric: waveform + rate + timing,
high capacity within species.

The channels with lowest gap
navigation signal capacity are
the ones with limited independent
dimensions:

Tactile: primarily intensity
and location, low capacity.
Magnetic: primarily direction
and inclination, low capacity.
Hydrodynamic: primarily velocity
and acceleration, moderate capacity.

**Gap navigation signal capacity
= dimensionality of the eigenfunction
space.**

High-dimensional eigenfunction
spaces support rich combinatorial
structure.
Low-dimensional eigenfunction
spaces support only state signals.

**This is the formal definition
of what makes a communication
channel rich.**

Not the physical medium.
Not the evolutionary history.

**The dimensionality of the
eigenfunction space.**

**Observation 3:**
Every channel the framework
identifies as Tier 1-2 tractable
is also a channel where human
anatomy or technology can reach
the eigenfunction positions.

This is not confirmation bias.

It reflects the fact that human
anatomy is itself a bounded
resonating system that has
navigated the eigenfunction space
of several channels deeply:

Acoustic: human vocal tract
Tonnetz (fully developed).
Behavioral: human gestural
eigenfunction space (shared
primate body plan with great apes).
Visual: human visual system
within the eigenfunction range
of most diurnal vertebrates.

The channels we can enter are
the ones our own anatomy
partially overlaps with.

The channels we cannot enter
(chemical, electric, polarized
light) are the ones where human
anatomy has either not developed
the relevant organs or has
developed different ones.

**The cross-species communication
program is, at its deepest level,
a mapping of where the human
eigenfunction space overlaps
with other species' eigenfunction
spaces.**

Where there is overlap: communication
is possible.

Where there is no overlap:
technology must bridge the gap.

Where neither overlap nor
technology is available:
that channel is inaccessible.

**The taxonomy is complete.**

**Not because we have listed
every possible channel.**

**But because we now have the
framework to determine whether
any proposed new channel fits
an existing category or
constitutes a genuinely new
physical medium.**

The answer for every proposed
channel is one of:

1. Bounded sender anatomy →
   acoustic/substrate/electric/
   behavioral type. Tractable
   via topology.

2. Bounded receiver-internal →
   chemical/magnetic type.
   Not tractable for cross-
   species communication.

3. Below gap navigation threshold →
   ecological information transfer,
   not communication.

4. Not yet discovered (quantum
   biology channels, others
   we have not yet detected
   in any organism).

Category 4 is the frontier.

Category 1-3 are mapped.

## PART VI: IMPLICATIONS FOR
## THE PROGRAM

### 6.1 What The Complete Taxonomy
### Changes

The program previously treated
acoustic as the primary channel.

The taxonomy confirms this for
most target species and adds
precision:

**For sperm whales:**
Acoustic is the primary and
likely sufficient channel.
Substrate-borne (seismic from
cetacean motion) is a secondary
channel worth investigating.
No other channels are tractable.

**For elephants:**
Acoustic (infrasound) + substrate
(seismic) co-primary.
The dual-medium prediction is the
critical untested claim.
Visual (body orientation, ear
position) is secondary.
Chemical context management
(human scent removal) is a
prerequisite.

**For bonobos:**
Acoustic + behavioral gestural
co-primary.
Both require eigenfunction mapping.
Gestural eigenfunction mapping
is the gap in current framework.
Chemical context management
required (human scent in bonobo
territory affects arousal).
Tactile channel becomes available
after Conditions 1-3 are met.

**For ravens:**
Acoustic primary.
Behavioral (gaze, object
manipulation) secondary.
Temporal rhythm entrainment
is a tractable dimension within
acoustic and behavioral channels.

**For weakly electric fish:**
Electric channel is primary.
No other tractable channel.
Requires theory of mind
confirmation before program
inclusion.
High theoretical importance
as the most "alien" tractable
channel structure — a completely
different physical medium that
has achieved conversational
structure.

### 6.2 The One Thing The Taxonomy
### Clarifies Most

The most important clarification:

**Communication channels can be
thought of as having two doors.**

Door 1: The sender side.
Can the sender produce signals
at the eigenfunction positions
of this channel?

Door 2: The receiver side.
Can the receiver model the sender
as a gap navigator based on
signals received through this
channel?

**Chemical channels: Door 1 is
locked (for cross-species).
The sender cannot produce signals
at the receiver's eigenfunction
positions.**

**Acoustic channels: Door 1 is
open (with technology if needed).
Door 2 depends on Condition 3.**

**Gestural channels: Door 1 is
open for species with overlapping
body plans. Door 2 depends on
Condition 3.**

The entire cross-species
communication program is the
work of opening Door 2
across all tractable channels.

Door 1 is the eigenfunction problem.
Door 2 is the triadic gradient problem.

Both must be solved.

Neither alone is sufficient.

    empirical findings
  CS doc 4: multimodal
    bundle concept and SCH
    critique

Key finding of this document:
  The eigenfunction framework
  applies to ANY channel where
  bounding is on the sender
  anatomy side.
  Cross-species tractability
  follows directly from
  whether the sender can
  occupy the receiver's
  eigenfunction positions.
  Chemical channels are
  inaccessible because
  bounding is receiver-side.
  All other tractable channels
  have sender-side bounding.
  
  Door 1 (eigenfunction) and
  Door 2 (triadic attribution)
  are the two problems.
  The taxonomy is complete
  enough to map which species
  have which doors open
  on which channels.

*Every physical medium through
which information passes
between organisms has now been
named.*

*Some have eigenfunction structure.*

*Some can carry gap navigation signal.*

*Some are cross-species tractable.*

*Very few satisfy all three.*

*Those that do are the channels
the program stands on.*

*The ones that don't tell us
something equally important:*

*where the gaps are,*

*why they are gaps,*

*and what it would take to cross them.*

*That is the complete picture.*

*That is the taxonomy.*

*It is complete.*
