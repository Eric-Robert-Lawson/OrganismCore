provenance: arises from three
  converging observations:
  (1) the wrasse reversed-protocol
  finding (CS doc 6): self-model
  already present, priming reveals
  it
  (2) the convergent olfactory
  self-model finding (CS doc 7):
  modality determines where
  self-model lives
  (3) a first-principles thought
  experiment: what would a dog
  experience smelling itself?
primary_intuition_source: the
  following reasoning chain was

  and is preserved verbatim as
  the seed:
  ---
  "A dog visually observing itself
  would observe itself in public
  visually.
  But what if it SMELLED itself.
  Would it recognize itself,
  a sense of familiarity? Would
  it even identify a difference
  in the smell sense it always
  would be able to smell itself?
  Would it be the same as mirror?"

  This is the correct question.
  This document derives why.

## PART I: WHAT THE MIRROR TEST
## IS ACTUALLY MEASURING

### 1.1 The Standard Account

The standard account of the MSR test:

```
GALLUP (1970):
  Test: Mark on body, visible
  only in mirror.
  
  PASS: Animal investigates
  the mark (infers the mark
  is on its own body using
  mirror information).
  
  INTERPRETATION: Animal has
  a self-model.
  
  SPECIES THAT PASS:
  Great apes, dolphins, elephants,
  magpies, some corvids, cleaner
  wrasse (2019 contested, 2026
  confirmed).
  
  SPECIES THAT FAIL (majority):
  Dogs, cats, most mammals,
  most birds, all reptiles,
  most fish.
```

This account treats the test
as a presence/absence detection:
either you have a self-model
or you don't, and the mirror reveals which.

### 1.2 The Revised Account
### (What the Wrasse Taught Us)

The wrasse reversed-protocol
(CS doc 6) forces a revision:

```
REVISED ACCOUNT:

The MSR test has TWO questions
inside it, not one:

Q1: Does the animal have a
    self-model?
    (Self-model presence)

Q2: Does the animal know that
    mirrors are a tool for
    accessing its self-model?
    (Mirror-as-tool knowledge)

The standard protocol tests Q2
and infers Q1.

But Q1 and Q2 are separable.

An animal can have a complete,
fully operational self-model (Q1)
and still need time to learn
that a specific reflective surface
is a tool for examining that model
(Q2).

The standard protocol conflates
these and calls the combined
result "self-awareness."
```

**The wrasse result proves separation:**

Reversed protocol (mark before mirror):
→ Recognition in 30 minutes.
→ Self-model was pre-existing.
→ Mirror-learning time was ~4-6 days,
  not self-model-building time.

**Implication for every species
that "failed" the MSR test:**

They may have failed Q2 while
having a fully operational Q1.

The test was measuring the
wrong question.

### 1.3 What Priming Does

**Priming** = bringing an existing
self-model into operational salience
in the domain relevant to the test.

When the wrasse was marked BEFORE
mirror exposure:
- The self-model was already primed
  in the body-surface-inspection domain
  (the wrasse inspects surfaces
  professionally, all day)
- The mark created an anomaly in
  the ALREADY ACTIVE self-model
- The mirror, when introduced,
  was immediately useful as a
  tool for investigating that anomaly

When the standard protocol applies
the mark AFTER mirror exposure:
- The self-model may not be primed
  in the visual domain at the moment
  of mark application
- The animal must first build a
  mirror-as-tool model (Q2)
- And THEN apply it to investigate
  the mark

**The critical insight:**

The reversed protocol is not
a kinder or easier version of the test.

**It is a more accurate test
of Q1 specifically.**

By separating Q1 from Q2, it
isolates what we actually care about:
does the self-model exist?

---

## PART II: THE DOG PROBLEM
## IN FULL DEPTH

### 2.1 The Question Stated Precisely

The question that emerged in
conversation:

*"A dog visually observing itself
in public would observe itself.
But what if it SMELLED itself?
Would it recognize itself, a sense
of familiarity? Would it even
identify a difference in the smell —
since it always would be able to
smell itself? Would it be the same
as mirror?"*

This question contains at least
three independent insights:

**Insight 1:**
The dog's primary self-model
is not visual — it is olfactory.
(Testing a dog with a mirror is
testing the wrong channel.)

**Insight 2:**
The dog is ALWAYS smelling itself.
(Unlike the visual channel, the
olfactory channel is continuously
broadcasting — the dog's own scent
is present in every sniffing moment.)

**Insight 3:**
If the dog is always smelling itself,
would the olfactory self-model
be SO continuously primed that
no anomaly would register?

This third insight is the hardest
and most interesting one.
Let me develop it precisely.

### 2.2 The Continuous Priming Problem

The visual self-model is NOT
continuously active in most animals.

A dog is not usually looking at
its own body. Its eyes are pointed
outward at the environment.
The visual self-model is activated
episodically — when looking at
paws, noticing a mark on the fur,
or perceiving its own shadow.

**The visual channel is episodically
self-referential.**

The olfactory channel is different.

A dog is ALWAYS in a cloud of its
own scent.

Every breath contains its own
odor molecules.

The olfactory self-model in a dog
is not episodically accessed.
It is the BACKGROUND.

It is the prior.

When a dog encounters a new smell,
it computes it against a background
that always includes itself.

**The olfactory self-model in a dog
is the zero-point baseline.**

### 2.3 What This Means for the
### STSR (Sniff Test of Self-Recognition)

If the olfactory self-model is the
zero-point baseline:

A dog sniffing its own UNALTERED scent
should show minimal investigation
behavior.

Not because it does not recognize
its own scent.

But because it has ALREADY recognized
it and the result is: EXPECTED.
No anomaly. No gap. No RARFL trigger.

The self-model is continuously
maintained precisely because the
input is continuous and always
matches the prior.

The olfactory self-model requires
NO priming in a dog.

It is the most primed model
in the dog's entire cognitive
architecture, constantly.

**This is the resolution to the
question "would it even identify
a difference?":**

It would identify NO difference
between encountering its own
unaltered scent and its usual
continuous self-scent awareness.

It is already smelling itself.
It is always already smelling itself.
The test adds nothing.

**BUT:**

If the scent is ALTERED —
a novel element added to its
own baseline scent —

Now there IS a gap.

Expected state: own scent = X
Detected state: own scent = X + Y

**Y is the anomaly.**

Y triggers RARFL.

Y triggers investigation.

**This is exactly what Horowitz found.**

Dogs do NOT investigate their own
unaltered scent more than other
stimuli.

Dogs DO investigate their own
ALTERED scent significantly more.

The test only works because
it creates a gap in an already-
active, continuously maintained
self-model.

### 2.4 The Difference Between
### Mirror and Smell

The question: "Would it be the same
as mirror?"

**Structural comparison:**

```
VISUAL MIRROR TEST:
  Self-model domain: visual
  Baseline activity: LOW
    (dog not looking at itself
    continuously)
  Test stimulus: reflection
    showing body with mark
  What the test requires:
    (1) Build mirror-as-tool model
    (2) Apply it to inspect body
  Priming required: HIGH
    (self-model not active
    in visual domain at test time)
  Result for dogs: FAIL
    (not because self-model absent
    but because visual domain
    self-model is not primed and
    mirror-as-tool knowledge
    requires extended learning)

OLFACTORY STSR:
  Self-model domain: olfactory
  Baseline activity: MAXIMUM
    (dog is always smelling itself)
  Test stimulus: own scent
    with novel element added
  What the test requires:
    (1) Detect anomaly against
        pre-existing baseline
    (2) Investigate anomaly
  Priming required: ZERO
    (self-model is maximally
    primed continuously)
  Result for dogs: PASS
    (Horowitz 2017: dogs
    investigate altered own
    scent more than unaltered)
```

**They are NOT the same.**

The mirror test requires priming
that dogs don't naturally get
in the visual domain.

The STSR requires zero priming
because the olfactory self-model
is already maximally active.

This is why the mirror test
failed for dogs and the STSR passed.

Not different cognitive capacities.

**Different priming requirements
for the same underlying capacity.**

### 2.5 The Dog in Public
### Seeing Itself — The Thought
### Experiment Developed

The question: if a dog saw itself
walking in public, would it react
to itself as another dog, or would
it be confused?

This is actually a deep question
about the structure of the visual
self-model in dogs.

Let's develop it precisely.

**Case A: Dog encounters visual
clone with own scent.**

Dog sees identical-looking dog.
Dog smells: own scent = baseline
match.

Result: Dog recognizes the scent
as familiar (its own scent is
the baseline it has been continuously
monitoring). The scent says "this
is mine" or "this is continuous
with me."

This would be cognitively
dissonant: visual system says
"another dog," olfactory system
says "this is me."

**Which system wins?**

For a dog: olfactory.

The dog would approach and
investigate the visual clone
but the sniff would return "self."
It would likely then disengage —
not treating the clone as a
rival or potential mate,
because the olfactory assessment
returns "familiar/self."

This is a testable prediction.

**Case B: Dog encounters its own
reflection in a full-length mirror
outdoors with its own scent present.**

The mirror produces: own scent
(no new smell from mirror).
Own visual form (reflected).
Own movement (contingent).

The dog approaches.

Olfactory assessment: no new smell.
Expected state. No anomaly.
This is not a threat and not
a potential mate — no scent signal.

Visual assessment: looks like a dog.
Contingency: when I move, it moves.

The dog may investigate briefly
but will likely disengage quickly —
the olfactory system says "nothing
here" and overrides the visual
"other dog" interpretation.

This is already partially documented:
dogs often ignore mirrors or
briefly investigate and then
stop reacting to them.

The standard explanation: they
learned the mirror has no scent
therefore it is not a real dog.

**The framework explanation is more precise:**

The olfactory self-model returned
a MATCH to its own baseline.
That match is registered as
"continuous with self" — not
as "other entity." The visual
anomaly (a dog-shaped entity
that moves with me) is overridden
by the olfactory prior.

The dog is not recognizing itself
in the mirror.

The dog is DISMISSING the mirror
because the olfactory channel
already resolved the question
before the visual channel could
do so.

**"Is there an interesting other entity here?"**

Olfactory answer: No. Just me.

Mirror investigation: terminated.

**This is olfactory self-awareness
expressed as mirror dismissal,
not mirror-blindness.**

The dog isn't confused by its
own reflection. It is CORRECT
about it. It's just computing
the answer in a domain the
experimenters weren't tracking.

---

## PART III: THE FALSIFIABLE
## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS

### 3.1 Experimental Architecture

The framework generates the following
testable predictions:

**Master Prediction:**
Any species with a well-developed
self-model in domain D will show
self-recognition when tested
with a primed, anomaly-detection
design in domain D.

Falsification condition: If a
species that shows all behavioral
correlates of deep self-model
navigation in domain D fails
an anomaly-detection test in
domain D under optimal conditions,
the framework is weakened.

### EXPERIMENT 1:
### The Reversed Olfactory Protocol
### for Dogs

```
WHAT IT TESTS:
  Q1 (self-model presence) in
  olfactory domain, with optimal
  priming conditions.
  The direct olfactory equivalent
  of the wrasse reversed protocol.

DESIGN:
  Phase 1: Collect dog's own urine
    sample (baseline scent).
  Phase 2: Apply novel scent
    to dog's OWN BODY — not to
    a canister. Apply to the
    dog's coat, near the source
    gland areas.
    (This is the mark. The dog
    cannot smell it directly
    because it is on its own body.)
  Phase 3: Present to the dog:
    (A) Canister with own urine
        + novel scent mixed
    (B) Canister with own urine
        (unaltered)
    (C) Canister with novel scent
        alone
    (D) Canister with unfamiliar
        dog urine

  Measure: investigation time
    per canister.

KEY PREDICTION:
  Dog investigates (A) significantly
  more than (B), (C), or (D).
  
  Specifically: dog investigates
  own-scent-altered MORE than
  novel-scent-alone.
  
  This demonstrates the anomaly
  is detected AGAINST THE SELF-
  MODEL BASELINE — not just as
  novel stimulus.

FALSIFICATION:
  If dog investigates (C) novel-
  scent-alone as much as (A)
  altered-own-scent:
  → The anomaly detection is not
    self-referential. Dog is just
    investigating novelty, not
    recognizing a change in its
    own baseline.
  → The self-model interpretation
    is weakened.

CRITICAL CONTROL:
  Apply the novel scent to a
  different dog's urine sample.
  Present altered-other-scent
  vs. altered-own-scent.
  
  If dog investigates both equally:
  → Anomaly detection is generic
    (not self-specific).
  
  If dog investigates altered-OWN
  more than altered-OTHER:
  → Self-specific anomaly detection
    confirmed.
  → This is the strong self-model
    signature.
```

---

### EXPERIMENT 2:
### The Body-Mark Olfactory Protocol
### (The True Olfactory Mirror Test)

```
WHAT IT TESTS:
  Whether dogs can use olfactory
  information to detect a change
  on their own body — the direct
  olfactory analog of the visual
  mark test.

DESIGN:
  Phase 1: Establish baseline.
    Dog is habituated to a
    testing chamber where its
    own scent is present (urine
    pad from own home territory).
  
  Phase 2: Apply mark.
    While dog is briefly
    sedated or during gentle
    restraint: apply a small
    patch of novel scent
    (e.g., novel oil) to a
    specific body location —
    the flank, where the dog
    CANNOT directly sniff (too
    far back on its own body).
  
  Phase 3: Introduce "olfactory
    mirror" — a surface that
    returns the dog's own scent.
    
    WHAT IS THE OLFACTORY MIRROR?
    This is the key design problem.
    
    OPTION A: Scent-reflection surface.
      A surface coated with the dog's
      own scent (collected earlier).
      The dog approaches, sniffs,
      detects own scent.
      
      But this does not reveal the
      BODY MARK — it just shows
      the baseline scent.
      
    OPTION B: Return-scent column.
      A column of air that carries
      the dog's own scent BACK at it
      with added novel-scent element
      (the mark chemical).
      
      The dog approaches, sniffs,
      detects: own scent + novel
      element = anomaly.
      
      If the dog then investigates
      its OWN FLANK (the marked
      location): SELF-ATTRIBUTION
      of the anomaly.
      
    OPTION C: Direct sniff return
    (Most elegant):
      Place the dog in front of a
      very short distance reflective
      surface AND provide the dog's
      own air stream reflected back
      at it (fan-and-filter setup
      that recirculates the dog's
      air column around to its nose
      with the mark chemical added).
      
      The dog smells its own air
      with a novel element in it.
      If it then sniffs at its own
      flank (where the mark was
      applied): hit.

KEY PREDICTION:
  Dogs that receive the scent-mark
  + olfactory-return condition will
  investigate their own flanks
  significantly more than:
  - Dogs that receive no mark
  - Dogs that receive a mark but
    no olfactory return
  - Dogs that receive a mark and
    olfactory return that does not
    include the novel element

FALSIFICATION:
  If dogs do not differentially
  investigate their marked flank
  under optimal conditions:
  → Olfactory self-attribution
    (connecting "anomaly in my
    scent cloud" to "something
    on my body") does not occur.
  → The olfactory self-model
    does not support body-
    location attribution.
  
  This would be a genuine failure —
  not a failure of the test but
  of the hypothesis.

NOTE ON INTERPRETATION:
  This is a harder test than the
  STSR. The STSR tests anomaly
  detection in own scent.
  This test additionally requires
  the dog to attribute the anomaly
  to its own body — which requires
  body-map integration with the
  olfactory self-model.
  
  Failure of this test does not
  mean no olfactory self-model.
  It means the olfactory self-model
  does not support body-location
  attribution in this domain.
  
  The wrasse PASSES the visual
  version of this test.
  Dogs may or may not pass
  the olfactory version.
  THIS IS AN OPEN EMPIRICAL QUESTION.
```

---

### EXPERIMENT 3:
### The Primed Visual MSR Test
### for Dogs

```
WHAT IT TESTS:
  Whether dogs can pass the VISUAL
  MSR test when the visual self-
  model is primed.
  
  The visual self-model in dogs is
  not typically primed. Can it be
  activated?

DESIGN:
  Phase 1: Establish visual
    body-monitoring behavior.
    Train dog to inspect its own
    paws and belly for "treats"
    (treats placed on its own body
    that it must visually locate and
    eat).
    
    THIS IS THE PRIMING PROCEDURE.
    
    This task requires the dog to:
    - Look at its own body
    - Monitor its own body surface
    - Develop a visual self-model
      of its own body in the context
      of anomaly-detection
    
    Run this training for 4-6 weeks
    to achieve robust behavior.
  
  Phase 2: Apply visual mark.
    Apply a colored, odorless mark
    to the dog's flank (same location
    it has been trained to inspect).
  
  Phase 3: Present mirror.
    Observe whether dog uses mirror
    to locate and investigate mark.

KEY PREDICTION:
  Dogs that have been trained in
  Phase 1 will show significantly
  higher rates of mirror-directed
  mark investigation than:
  - Naive control dogs (untrained)
  - Dogs trained in Phase 1 but
    not marked (to rule out general
    mirror investigation behavior)

WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:
  The priming procedure activates
  the visual self-model specifically
  in the body-surface-inspection
  domain.
  
  This is what the wrasse has
  permanently, by ecological niche.
  
  The dog is being given an
  artificial version of the
  wrasse's niche condition.
  
  If the hypothesis is correct,
  this should produce wrasse-like
  performance.

FALSIFICATION:
  If trained dogs perform no
  better than naive dogs:
  → The visual self-model in dogs
    cannot be primed through
    body-inspection training.
  → The dog's visual self-model
    has architectural limits
    that prevent MSR even when primed.
  → The modality-specific self-model
    principle needs revision.

SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATION IF PASSES:
  This would demonstrate that
  dogs HAVE the visual self-model
  capacity but it is simply not
  active by default.
  
  This would be the first
  demonstration of a trained
  MSR positive in a species
  that reliably fails untrained.
  
  It would support the homology
  hypothesis: the capacity is
  present but unpressured in
  the visual domain.

NOTE ON ETHICS AND METHODOLOGY:
  This experiment requires training
  before testing, which modifies
  the animal's cognitive engagement
  with its own body surface.
  It does not harm the animal —
  it simply activates a capacity
  by providing training.
  The same thing happens naturally
  in species that pass the MSR:
  their ecological niche provides
  the training.
```

### EXPERIMENT 4:
### The Cross-Modal Priming Test
### (Novel)

```
WHAT IT TESTS:
  Whether priming the olfactory
  self-model can enhance visual
  self-recognition — testing
  whether the self-models in
  different domains are connected
  or independent.

DESIGN:
  Phase 1: Apply both:
    (a) Olfactory mark (novel
        scent on dog's flank)
    (b) Visual mark (colored,
        odorless patch on same
        location)
    Simultaneously.
  
  Phase 2: Present mirror.
  
  Measure: Does the dog investigate
  its marked flank in the mirror
  more than:
  - Dogs with visual mark only
  - Dogs with olfactory mark only
  - Dogs with no mark

KEY PREDICTION:
  Dogs with BOTH marks will show
  higher rates of mark investigation
  in the mirror than dogs with
  visual mark only.
  
  The olfactory mark activates
  the body-surface anomaly detection
  system.
  
  This primes the body-surface
  self-model generally.
  
  The visual mark is then detected
  and investigated via the mirror
  because the body-surface self-model
  is already in the anomaly-detection
  mode triggered by the olfactory mark.

THIS IS THE CROSS-MODAL PRIMING
PREDICTION:
  
  Olfactory domain priming →
  activates body-surface self-model
  → enhances visual domain
  body-surface inspection →
  visual MSR becomes possible
  
  If this works, it would be the
  first cross-modal priming
  enhancement of MSR in any species.

FALSIFICATION:
  If dogs with both marks do not
  perform better than dogs with
  visual mark only:
  → The olfactory and visual
    self-models are independent —
    priming one does not enhance
    the other.
  → The self-models are modality-
    specific silos, not aspects
    of a unified self-model.
  
  The choice between these
  interpretations would tell us
  something fundamental about
  the architecture of self-models.
```

### EXPERIMENT 5:
### The Reversed Protocol in
### Olfactory-Primary Species
### (Deer and Bear)

```
WHAT IT TESTS:
  The modality-specific self-model
  principle in species whose
  olfactory domain is more
  elaborated than dogs.

DEER DESIGN (Odocoileus virginianus):

  Phase 1: Identify a doe with an
    established scrape site
    (natural "external memory"
    of her olfactory identity).
  
  Phase 2: Introduce a modified
    version of her own tarsal
    secretion at the scrape site —
    her own scent plus a novel
    element she has not encountered.
    
    Collect her tarsal secretion.
    Add a novel scent component.
    Re-deposit at her scrape site
    before her next visit.
  
  Phase 3: Observe her behavior
    at the scrape site.
    
    Compare to baseline visits
    (no modification) and to
    visits where a different
    deer's scent was added.

KEY PREDICTION:
  Doe investigates her own
  modified scrape MORE than:
  - Her unmodified scrape
  - A scrape modified with
    another deer's scent
    (which she would also investigate
    highly, but for different
    reasons — territorial challenge)
  
  DISTINGUISHING PREDICTION:
  The behavioral response to
  own-scent-modified vs.
  other-scent-added should differ
  in behavioral quality, not just
  quantity.
  
  Other-scent addition: territorial
  alert posture, rub-urination,
  heightened vigilance.
  
  Own-scent-modified: investigation
  focused on the scrape site itself,
  repeated close sniffing,
  possibly self-grooming of
  tarsal glands — as the deer
  checks her own chemical identity.
  
  THIS BEHAVIORAL QUALITY DIFFERENCE
  IS THE FALSIFIABLE PREDICTION.

BEAR DESIGN (Ursus americanus):

  Phase 1: Identify an established
    bear rub tree with recent
    individual's mark.
  
  Phase 2: Add a novel element
    to the rub tree that is
    derived from the bear's own
    body secretion plus modification.
    
    (This requires collecting
    a small sample of the bear's
    own secretion from the rub tree,
    modifying it in the lab,
    and reapplying to the same tree.)
  
  Phase 3: Camera trap the bear's
    return visit.
    
    Measure investigation duration
    and behavioral quality.

KEY PREDICTION:
  Bear shows extended investigation
  of modified own-scent rub tree
  compared to baseline return visits.
  
  Specific behavioral signature:
  bear rubs the tree again after
  extended sniffing — updating
  its own mark, which is the bear's
  version of investigating the
  anomaly and then re-establishing
  the correct self-model signal.
  
  This is the bear's equivalent
  of the wrasse scraping the mark
  off its body.
```

### EXPERIMENT 6:
### The Acoustic Anomaly Self-
### Recognition Test for Cetaceans

```
WHAT IT TESTS:
  The modality-specific principle
  in the acoustic domain —
  the cetacean equivalent of
  the STSR.

DESIGN (Bottlenose Dolphin):

  Phase 1: Record individual
    dolphin's signature whistle —
    its personal acoustic identity
    signal, maintained across
    its lifetime.
  
  Phase 2: Modify the signature
    whistle:
    (a) Alter the pitch contour
        slightly (shift Tonnetz
        position by a small amount)
    (b) Add a novel tonal element
    (c) Alter temporal rhythm
        (maintain pitch, shift timing)
    These are three independent
    modifications that test different
    aspects of the acoustic self-model.
  
  Phase 3: Play back the modified
    signature whistle to the dolphin
    via underwater speaker.
    
    Compare responses to:
    - Own unmodified whistle
    - Own modified whistle
    - Other dolphin's whistle
    - Other dolphin's modified whistle

KEY PREDICTION:
  Dolphin shows elevated response
  (whistle, approach, investigation)
  to own-modified whistle compared
  to own-unmodified whistle.
  
  The modification to OWN whistle
  registers as anomaly against
  acoustic self-model baseline.
  
  The modification to OTHER's
  whistle does NOT produce elevated
  response compared to unmodified
  other's whistle — because the
  self-model does not apply.
  
  THIS ASYMMETRY IS THE KEY
  FALSIFIABLE PREDICTION.
  
  Equal responses to own-modified
  and other-modified would suggest
  the response is to novelty generally,
  not to self-model anomaly specifically.
  
  Elevated response to own-modified
  over other-modified would confirm
  acoustic self-model with anomaly
  detection.

SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATION:
  If this works, it would demonstrate
  that cetaceans have an acoustic
  self-model analogous to the
  dog's olfactory self-model —
  an acoustic baseline representation
  of "my own voice" against which
  modifications are detected as gaps.
  
  This would connect the STSR
  framework to the Tonnetz
  eigenfunction framework —
  the acoustic self-model would
  occupy specific positions in
  the acoustic eigenfunction space
  and detect deviations from them.
  
  The cetacean would be doing
  olfactory-equivalent self-
  recognition in acoustic space.

### EXPERIMENT 7:
### The Primed Visual MSR Test
### Across Multiple "Failing" Species

```
BROADEST APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK:

If the reversed-protocol and
priming-protocol findings generalize:

Most species that "fail" the
standard MSR test fail because:
  (a) The visual domain is not
      their primary self-model domain
  OR
  (b) The visual self-model in
      the visual domain is not
      primed at the time of testing.

TEST THE GENERAL PREDICTION:

For each species, identify its
primary self-model domain and
the ecological niche that pressures
that domain. Design a priming
procedure that mimics the ecological
pressure. Then apply the MSR test
in the relevant domain.

PREDICTED OUTCOMES:

  Pigs (primary domain: olfactory
    + tactile/ground exploration):
    → STSR positive (test in
      olfactory domain)
    → Visual MSR negative without
      priming, potentially positive
      with body-inspection priming

  Horses (primary domain:
    olfactory + social visual):
    → STSR positive
    → Social-visual priming
      (training to inspect own
      body for rewards) may
      yield visual MSR positive

  Cats (primary domain: olfactory
    + tactile/grooming):
    → Cats groom themselves
      extensively — the grooming
      behavior is itself a continuous
      body-surface self-model
      maintenance behavior.
    → Cats with a mark in a
      grooming-inaccessible location
      that CANNOT be reached by
      their own tongue, tested with
      a mirror, should show higher
      investigation rates than
      the standard protocol.
    → Prediction: cats fail standard
      MSR but might pass a PRIMED
      protocol with a mark in a
      location that interrupts
      their existing grooming self-model.

  Monkeys (primary domain: visual
    + social — but standard MSR
    consistently fails):
    → Most puzzling MSR failure.
    → Possible explanation: monkey
      social visual domain is OTHER-
      directed, not SELF-directed.
      Monkeys monitor OTHER monkeys'
      faces, not their own.
    → Self-model is social-relational,
      not self-inspective.
    → Prediction: monkeys would pass
      a SOCIAL MIRROR test — a test
      where they see their reflection
      engaging in a social behavior
      that produces a social consequence.
    → But they would NOT pass the
      individual body-inspection test
      because their self-model is
      not organized around own-body-
      inspection.
    → The monkey case is the counter-
      example: a highly social,
      visually sophisticated primate
      whose self-model is paradoxically
      NOT oriented toward own-body
      inspection. This is predicted
      by the framework: self-model
      depth follows PRESSURE, not
      social complexity or brain size.
      Monkeys have not been pressured
      to inspect their own bodies
      visually the way the cleaner
      wrasse has been.

## PART IV: THE UNIFIED PRINCIPLE
## THIS DOCUMENT DERIVES

### What All Eight Experiments
### Are Testing

All eight experiments test the
same underlying principle:

**THE SELF-MODEL IS REAL,
CONTINUOUS, AND OPERATIONAL —
BUT IT IS DOMAIN-SPECIFIC
AND PRIMING-DEPENDENT FOR
TEST-VISIBILITY.**

The hierarchy of claims:

```
LEVEL 1 (Established):
  The olfactory self-model exists
  in olfactory-primary species.
  Evidence: Horowitz 2017 (dogs),
  Cazzolla Gatti 2021 (wolves),
  Freiburger 2024 (garter snakes).

LEVEL 2 (Established):
  The self-model is domain-specific —
  it operates in the primary
  sensory channel of the species.
  Evidence: same studies +
  ball python negative control.

LEVEL 3 (Predicted, Experiments 1-2):
  The olfactory self-model supports
  body-location attribution in
  olfactory-primary species.
  Not yet established.

LEVEL 4 (Predicted, Experiments 3-4):
  The self-model can be activated
  in non-primary domains through
  priming.
  Not yet established.

LEVEL 5 (Predicted, Experiments 5-6):
  The modality-specific principle
  generalizes to acoustic-primary
  species (cetaceans) and elaborated
  olfactory species (deer, bears).
  Not yet established.

LEVEL 6 (Predicted, Experiment 7):
  Most MSR failures in the literature
  are priming failures or domain
  mismatches, not self-model absences.
  Not yet established.
```

**Falsifying Level 1 would overturn
the convergent olfactory self-model
framework entirely.**

Horowitz 2017 would need to be
non-replicable. Garter snake results
would need to be noise.
Unlikely but possible.

**Establishing Level 6 would be
the most significant advance
in comparative cognition since
Gallup's original mirror test.**

It would require a systematic
replication program across 10-20
previously-failed species using
domain-appropriate primed tests.

It would almost certainly find
self-recognition in most of them.

## PART V: THE DOG THOUGHT
## EXPERIMENT — FINAL RESOLUTION

The question that opened this document:

*"What if a dog smelled itself?
Would it recognize itself?
Would it even identify a difference?"*

**The answer, fully derived:**

**Yes, it recognizes itself — constantly.**

The olfactory self-model is the
zero-point baseline. Every breath
is self-recognition. The dog is
continuously and successfully
recognizing that the scent cloud
it inhabits is its own.

This is not trivial. This is
the most primed, most continuously
active, most operationally robust
self-model in the dog's entire
cognitive architecture.

**No, it would not notice
its own unaltered smell as something
special or anomalous.**

Because there is no anomaly.

The unaltered self-scent matches
the continuously-maintained model
exactly. The RARFL cycle is not
triggered. The investigation
behavior is not activated.

This is not a failure of self-recognition.

**It is perfect self-recognition
so successfully maintained that
it produces nothing observable.**

The test fails to detect it not
because it is absent — but because
the test is looking for the SIGNAL
OF RECOGNITION, which only appears
when there is a GAP.

And there is no gap when the
self-model perfectly matches
the continuous input.

**The altered-scent test works
because it CREATES a gap.**

The gap is artificial.
The gap is the novel element added
to the baseline.

But the gap detection —
the investigation behavior —
is real, is genuine, is the
unmistakable signature of a
self-model that notices when
its own state has been changed.

**The dog knew itself all along.**

We just didn't know how to ask.
