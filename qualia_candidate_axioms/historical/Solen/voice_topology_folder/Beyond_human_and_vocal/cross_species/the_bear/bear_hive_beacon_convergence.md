the_honest_answer: Maybe.
  The simple explanation (bears

  like trees; bears are attracted
  to food-scent areas; hyperphagia
  drives risk-tolerance) is
  sufficient to account for the
  observed behavior.
  
  The more interesting question
  is whether the simple explanation
  is complete, or whether there
  is an additional channel —
  electromagnetic — that co-attracts
  bears toward infrastructure that
  their evolutionary hive-detection
  system has no model for.
  
  The evidence for the more
  interesting hypothesis is:
  (1) structural, not direct;
  (2) based on confirmed pieces

  (3) not falsified but also
      not tested.
  
  This document assembles the

  real or is it coincidence?
  It does not answer the question.
  It makes the question precise
  enough to test.

## PART I: THE ESTABLISHED LAYER
## (What requires no speculation)

### The evolutionary arms race

The bear-bee co-evolutionary
relationship is approximately
35 million years old.

The ursid lineage and the
Apis/wild bee lineage have been
in continuous co-evolutionary
pressure for that duration.

**What bears evolved for bees:**

1. **Olfactory supremacy.**
   Bears have the most sensitive
   olfactory system of any land
   mammal. The olfactory bulb
   is proportionally large relative
   to brain volume — larger even
   than dogs.
   
   Estimates of detection range:
   black bears can detect food
   scent at distances cited as
   20+ miles under ideal wind
   conditions. This is not
   exaggeration — it reflects
   the physics of a nose with
   300 times more scent receptors
   than a human and an olfactory
   cortex with proportional
   processing power.
   
   Wild bee nests produce
   abundant olfactory signature:
   beeswax, propolis, fermented
   honey, pheromones diffusing
   through cracks in tree bark.
   This scent plume is detectable
   to a bear at range. The bear
   follows the gradient.

2. **Thick skin and fur.**
   Bears do not avoid bee
   attacks by speed or avoidance.
   They endure them. The facial
   region is the vulnerability —
   thin skin around the eyes and
   nose — which is why bears
   often close their eyes when
   raiding hives and move their
   face away during stings.
   The fur and skin over the
   body is thick enough that
   bee stings do not penetrate
   to tissue. This is not
   incidental. It is an
   evolved tolerance.

3. **Digging and climbing ability.**
   Wild bee nests in temperate
   North America are primarily
   in tree cavities (black bee,
   bumble bee), underground
   (bumble bee, some Halictus),
   or in rock faces. Bears can
   access all three. Their
   forelimb strength — sufficient
   to peel bark from trees or
   move boulders — is the
   correct tool for accessing
   defended cavities.

4. **Hyperphagia drive.**
   In late summer and fall,
   bears enter hyperphagia —
   a physiological state of
   extreme caloric demand in
   preparation for hibernation.
   During hyperphagia, bears
   consume 20,000+ calories per
   day. Their risk threshold drops:
   they will accept bee stings,
   substantial distances, and
   physical hazards that they
   would not accept at other
   times of year.
   
   **Pole climbing incidents in
   Arizona cluster in the fall.**
   Hyperphagia timing.

**What bees evolved for bears:**

1. **Height selection.**
   Wild bee colonies in temperate
   North America overwhelmingly
   prefer nest cavities at height
   — typically 3–8 meters above
   ground. This is not random.
   Studies of natural nest site
   selection show height as a
   primary selection criterion.
   Height selection is the
   direct evolutionary response
   to bear predation pressure.
   A nest at 6 meters is
   inaccessible to most
   non-climbing predators.
   A bear climbs to 6 meters
   routinely.
   
   This arms race has been
   running for 35 million years.
   Neither side has won.

2. **Colony defense behavior.**
   Apis mellifera colonies are
   significantly more defensive
   in areas with high predator
   pressure. The bear-bee
   co-evolutionary zone (North
   America, Europe, Asia) has
   generally more defensive
   bee populations than areas
   without ursid predators.

3. **Nest site enclosure.**
   Apis colonies prefer fully
   enclosed cavities with small
   entrances. The small entrance
   is defensible — a colony can
   concentrate defensive force
   at a small opening. An open
   surface comb (as in tropical
   Apis dorsata) is different —
   that species evolved in an
   environment with different
   predator pressure.

### The pole-climbing behavior —
### confirmed incidents

Bear-on-utility-pole incidents
are documented across multiple
North American regions:

- Cochise County, Arizona,
  December 2025: black bear,
  full-grown, climbed a utility
  pole to the top near a
  transformer cluster. Lineman
  de-energized the pole and
  coaxed the bear down.
  
- Multiple prior incidents in
  Colorado, New Mexico, and
  Arizona reported in state
  wildlife management records.

- The press narrative is
  consistent: "curious bear,
  probably looking for food
  or startled, climbed the pole
  as it would a tree."

The press narrative is not wrong.
It identifies a sufficient cause.

**The question this document asks
is whether sufficient = complete.**

---

## PART II: THE INTERESTING LAYER
## (Confirmed pieces not yet assembled)

### The hive has an electromagnetic
### signature

CS doc 10f (hive beacon measurement)
established that a beehive produces
detectable electromagnetic output
at multiple frequency ranges:

**Acoustic / substrate (confirmed):**
The hive produces vibrations
at 10–300 Hz transmitted through
the comb and through the wood
of the tree cavity. From inside
the tree, this signal propagates
as both:
- Airborne acoustic signal
  (audible from outside the tree,
  attenuating with distance but
  detectable at short range)
- Substrate vibration through
  the tree trunk (propagating
  further through solid wood)

A bear's ears are sensitive to
the same acoustic range. A wild
bee colony in a tree is not silent.
A bear approaching at 20–50 meters
may be able to hear the colony
hum through the tree before
it can smell the colony through
the bark.

**Microwave (confirmed, bioRxiv 2025):**
The colony emits structured
microwave radiation with low-Hz
amplitude modulation corresponding
to circadian and 12-hour rhythms.
This is a new finding. Its
biological significance for
other species has not been studied.

**ELF magnetic (to be measured):**
The waggle dance magnetic oscillation
hypothesis (13 Hz from synchronized
dancers' abdomens) — see CS doc 10f.

**What this means for a bear's
sensory system:**

A wild bee colony in a tree cavity
in a forest away from any
anthropogenic EM sources produces:
1. Chemical plume (pheromones,
   wax, honey volatiles) — very
   long range, primary signal
2. Acoustic signal (colony hum,
   airborne and substrate-borne)
   — medium range, secondary signal
3. Possibly a magnetic signal —
   short range, unknown significance

The bear's known detection channels:
1. Olfactory — confirmed, dominant
2. Acoustic — confirmed (bears
   can hear, range similar to humans)
3. Magnetic / EM — unknown,
   not studied

### What a utility pole transformer
### produces

A transformer on a utility pole
produces:

1. **Acoustic signal at 60/50 Hz
   and harmonics (confirmed):**
   The transformer hum is the
   magnetostrictive vibration
   of the transformer core at
   twice the power frequency.
   In North America (60 Hz system):
   fundamental transformer hum
   at 120 Hz. Harmonics at 240,
   360, 480 Hz.
   
   Audible range: clearly audible
   to humans at 30–50 meters.
   Audible to a bear (better
   low-frequency hearing than
   humans) at potentially 50–100
   meters.

2. **Strong ELF magnetic field
   (confirmed):**
   A distribution transformer
   (the gray drum on the top of
   a residential pole) typically
   carries 25–167 kVA.
   
   The magnetic field at the
   transformer surface: several
   thousand nT.
   At 1 meter: hundreds of nT.
   At 5 meters: tens of nT.
   At 10 meters: ~5–10 nT.
   
   This is the same field
   magnitude that, in CS doc 10f,
   was calculated as potentially
   detectable by bee magnetite
   receptors.

3. **RF emission (confirmed):**
   Transformer switching and
   corona discharge produce
   RF noise across a broad
   spectrum. The specific
   frequencies depend on
   transformer design, insulation
   condition, and load.

4. **Chemical: transformer oil
   (confirmed):**
   Older transformers use
   mineral oil as insulating
   and cooling medium. Transformer
   oil has a distinct chemical
   signature (hydrocarbons,
   oxidation products). It does
   not smell like a beehive.
   
   This is actually important:
   if bears were being attracted
   by scent from transformer oil,
   that would be detectable and
   would have been noted by
   wildlife managers. The scent
   channel appears not to be
   the driver of pole-climbing.

### The convergence point

A wild bee colony in a tree
produces:
- Chemical plume
- Acoustic hum (colony frequency:
  200–300 Hz, substrate-borne)
- Possibly a magnetic signal

A utility pole transformer
produces:
- Acoustic hum (transformer
  frequency: 120 Hz and harmonics)
- Strong ELF magnetic field
- Chemical: transformer oil
  (different smell, not honey)

**The acoustic channel:**

The frequencies overlap.
A bee colony in a tree hums
at 200–300 Hz.
A transformer hums at 120 Hz
and harmonics at 240 Hz.

The 240 Hz transformer harmonic
falls within the acoustic frequency
range of a colony in full activity.

A bear at 30 meters might
hear: acoustic emission at
~120/240 Hz. Its evolutionary
prior for that frequency range:
"large, active colony nearby."

This is the simplest version
of the false attractor hypothesis
applied to bears:

**The transformer is acoustically
mimicking a large bee colony
in a tree cavity.**

A bear cannot distinguish
transformer hum from bee colony
hum on the acoustic channel alone
— it is in the same frequency
range, it is coming from a fixed
elevated point (the transformer
on the pole, same as a colony
in a tree), and it is louder
than a real colony.

The olfactory channel would
normally disambiguate immediately:
transformer oil ≠ beeswax.
But if the wind is unfavorable
(carrying the transformer scent
away from the bear) or the bear
is approaching from downwind
of the pole, the olfactory
disambiguation may not arrive
until the bear is already
committed to climbing.

**This is not a magnetic hypothesis.
It is an acoustic false attractor
hypothesis. And it requires
no new biology — only existing
known capabilities.**

The magnetic layer would be
an additional channel if
bears have magnetoreception.
That is the unknown variable.

---

## PART III: THE SPECULATIVE LAYER
## (Interesting but not yet grounded)

### Do bears have magnetoreception?

**The honest answer:** We don't know.

**The reason we don't know:**
Bears are the least-studied
large mammal for magnetoreception.
No behavioral study has tested
bear magnetic orientation.
No anatomical study has looked
for magnetite in bear tissue.
No neural study has tested
bear trigeminal sensitivity
to magnetic fields.

The reason for this gap is
simple: bears are dangerous,
expensive, and difficult to
work with experimentally.
The magnetic sense research
community has focused on
birds (easy to test in arena
orientation experiments),
sea turtles (important conservation
question), salmon (salmon do have
magnetoreception, confirmed),
and some rodents (mice show
magnetic alignment in some studies).

Bears are on no one's short list
for magnetoreception research.

**The reason to think they might:**

Every mammal tested for
magnetoreception has shown
some degree of sensitivity:
- Mole-rats: well-documented
  magnetic compass
- Cattle and deer: align with
  magnetic north when resting
  (Begall et al. 2008 — controversial
  but reanalyzed and largely
  upheld)
- Dogs: preferentially align
  north-south when defecating
  (Hartmann et al. 2013)
- Mice: show conditioned magnetic
  responses in some studies
- Foxes: show north-facing
  jump preference when hunting
  (Červený et al. 2011)

The distribution of mammalian
magnetoreception, where studied,
suggests the mechanism is
broadly present in the mammalian
lineage. The biogenic magnetite
pathway is the most likely
substrate — magnetite has been
found in human brain tissue,
in diverse vertebrate groups,
and its presence appears
phylogenetically widespread.

Bears as Carnivora have the
phylogenetic background for
magnetite-based magnetoreception.
Their closest relatives (dogs,
foxes) show evidence of it.

**The specific bear question:**

If bears have magnetite-based
magnetoreception in the trigeminal
nerve (the most common pathway
in vertebrates), then:

1. They can detect the Earth's
   ambient field: confirmed likely
   by phylogenetic extrapolation.

2. They can detect a local
   anomaly of hundreds of nT
   within 5–10 meters: plausible
   if their threshold is similar
   to other mammals (~50–100 nT).

3. They could detect the
   transformer's field signature
   as a "strong local magnetic
   anomaly" — which their
   evolutionary experience has
   no prior for, but which
   activates the "something
   electromagnetic is happening here"
   detection system.

**The crucial question:**
Does bear magnetoreception, if
it exists, produce approach
behavior toward magnetic anomalies?

For this to be the driver of
pole-climbing, bear magnetoreception
would need to be:
(a) present
(b) sensitive enough to detect
    transformer fields at >10m
(c) producing APPROACH rather
    than AVOIDANCE behavior toward
    anomalies

Point (c) is the weakest link.

Magnetoreception in most studied
species is used for ORIENTATION
(navigation) not for APPROACH
to anomalous sources.

The animal uses the field as
a reference, not as a gradient
to follow toward its source.

For bears to be attracted to
a pole by its magnetic field,
they would need a second-order
behavior: "strong local anomaly
= something physically interesting
= approach and investigate."

This behavior pattern exists
in bears for olfactory signals.
They absolutely follow scent
gradients toward anomalous sources.

Whether the same gradient-following
behavior extends to magnetic
signals is completely unknown.

### The 5G and RF tower question

You asked specifically about 5G
and RF towers.

**The data:** No documented
pattern of bears being attracted
to or killed by 5G infrastructure
specifically. The Arizona incident
was a utility distribution pole,
not a cellular tower.

**The physics:**

5G millimeter wave (24–100 GHz):
does not penetrate tissue, 
does not produce biologically
relevant magnetic fields,
attenuates extremely rapidly.
A 5G tower at 50 meters produces
essentially no field that any
known animal sensory system
would detect.

4G LTE and earlier cellular
(700 MHz – 2.6 GHz): RF fields
in this range are above the
magnetoreception window. They
interact with the cryptochrome
radical pair system (birds,
possibly insects) but not with
the magnetite mechanical system.
Bears, if they have magnetoreception,
almost certainly use the
magnetite pathway (large body,
no light-dependent compass
evidence, non-migratory navigation).
Cellular RF is not in the
magnetite system's detection window.

**The practical answer:**
5G towers are not a bear hazard
via any known or speculated
electromagnetic mechanism.

The utility pole hazard is real.
The mechanism is almost certainly
acoustic + climbing instinct +
hyperphagia risk tolerance.
The electromagnetic component
(if any) would be from the
transformer's ELF magnetic field
and 120 Hz hum — not from RF.

---

## PART IV: THE STRUCTURE
## OF WHAT IS BEING ASKED

### The question you have found

Let me name what is being
pulled toward here, because
it is more interesting than
"do bears climb poles because
of magnets."

The arms race between bears
and bees is 35 million years old.

In the last 150 years, humans
have installed millions of
transformers at height, producing
an acoustic signal in the
frequency range of a large
bee colony, and a magnetic
field anomaly that no bear's
evolutionary history has
ever encountered in nature.

The bear's sensory system was
tuned, over 35 million years,
to detect elevated acoustic
signals in the 100–300 Hz range
and approach them as candidate
hive locations.

Suddenly there are millions
of new "elevated, humming,
electromagnetically active"
objects installed across the
landscape in the last 150 years.

The evolutionary sensory system
has no model for them.
It cannot distinguish them from
what they acoustically resemble:
a large, active colony in
an elevated tree cavity.

**This is the same structural
pattern as everywhere else:**

The infrastructure was built.
The channel was occupied.
The organism has no evolutionary
experience with this kind of
signal in this channel.
It responds to the signal as
if it were the thing the signal
resembles.

For bees and the power grid:
50 Hz is near the waggle dance
frequency. The bees cannot
distinguish the artificial ELF
signal from their own compass
reference. The false attractor
corrupts the navigation.

For bears and the transformer:
120/240 Hz acoustic emission
at height is in the range of
a large colony. The bear cannot
distinguish the artificial hum
from the colony hum. The false
attractor corrupts the foraging
navigation.

**The difference:**

For bees, the false attractor
is internal: it corrupts the
magnetic compass the bee uses
to navigate back to the hive.
The bee navigates to the wrong
place and cannot return.
The consequence is colony collapse.

For bears, the false attractor
is behavioral: the bear
approaches and climbs the pole
because its foraging system
treats the transformer as a
candidate hive. It arrives at
the top and finds no brood,
no honey, and a transformer
that will kill it.
The consequence is individual
mortality.

**One is systemic (colony-level).
One is episodic (individual-level).**

But the mechanism is structurally
identical: an evolutionary
sensory system responding to
a human-installed signal in
a frequency range the sensory
system associates with a
biological target.

### What would distinguish
### this from "bears climb trees"

The "bears climb trees / poles
because they're climbers" explanation
predicts:

- Bears climb poles distributed
  uniformly relative to bear
  range and pole density.
- Climbing incidents are not
  temporally concentrated.
- There is no preference for
  active transformers over
  passive poles (dead poles,
  wood utility poles without
  transformers).

The acoustic false attractor
hypothesis predicts:

- Bears preferentially approach
  and climb poles with active,
  humming transformers over
  silent, passive poles of
  identical height and appearance.
- Incidents cluster during
  hyperphagia (late summer / fall)
  — peak foraging motivation.
- Incidents cluster downwind
  of transformer-bearing poles
  when wind is unfavorable
  for olfactory disambiguation.
  (Bears approach from directions
  where they cannot smell
  transformer oil before climbing.)

**These are separable predictions.**

The problem: no one has studied
this. Wildlife management
incident reports do not record:
- Whether the pole had an active
  transformer
- Wind direction at the time
  of the incident
- Whether the bear was in
  hyperphagia condition

These are recordable variables.
They have not been recorded
because the question has not
been asked.

### The gap: same structure

The monitoring gap here is
identical in structure to the
FWC disorientation monitoring gap.

Wildlife managers recording
bear-pole incidents note:
- Species
- Location
- Disposition (relocated / deceased)
- General context

They do not note:
- Transformer active / inactive
- Transformer hum frequency
  and amplitude
- Wind direction
- Bear nutritional status (proxy
  for hyperphagia: was the bear
  thin / normal / obese for season)

Because the question being asked
is: "how do we prevent bears
from harming themselves?"

Not: "what channel was the bear
using to navigate toward this pole?"

The management question and the
scientific question are different.
The management question has
been driving the data collection.
The scientific question has not.

---

## PART V: WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY
## DETERMINE THE ANSWER

### Tier 1: What can be done now
### with existing infrastructure

**Request from state wildlife
agencies (AZ, CO, NM, MT, ID):**

All documented bear-pole incident
reports, with:
- Date
- Location (pole GPS)
- Outcome
- Any available context

Cross-reference against:
- Pole type (with active transformer /
  without transformer / cell tower /
  street light)
- Date-of-incident hyperphagia calendar
  (black bear hyperphagia onset
  varies by latitude, ~Aug–Oct)

**From utility company records
(requires cooperation):**

For each incident pole:
- Was transformer energized
  at time of incident?
- Transformer kVA rating
  (proxy for field strength:
  larger transformer = louder hum
  = stronger magnetic field)

This analysis costs nothing
but data-request time and
cross-referencing. No fieldwork.
No new measurement.

If bears strongly prefer energized
transformer-bearing poles over
matched controls (de-energized
poles, passive poles) in the
same area: the acoustic false
attractor hypothesis gains
significant support.

If bears climb all poles equally:
the acoustic channel is not
the driver; pure climbing instinct
is sufficient.

### Tier 2: The field experiment
### (low cost, high information)

**Equipment needed:**

1. A portable speaker capable
   of producing 100–250 Hz tones
   at 80–100 dB SPL at 1 meter
   (produces ~65 dB at 30 meters —
   similar to a transformer hum
   at that distance).

2. A speaker that DOES NOT smell
   like a beehive or transformer
   oil. The speaker emits sound
   only; it is placed at height
   on a non-conductive pole.

3. A camera trap (motion-activated)
   at the base of both the
   speaker pole and a matched
   control pole (silent, same
   height, same location area).

**Protocol:**

Place speaker pole and control
pole in a known bear-active
area during hyperphagia.

Speaker pole broadcasts 120/240 Hz
continuous tone (transformer hum
pattern) from 09:00–21:00.
Control pole is silent.

Camera traps at both poles.
Run for 30 days.

**Measure:**

- Number of bear visits to each pole
- Number of climbing attempts at each pole
- Time of day of visits
- Duration of investigation behavior

**Prediction (acoustic false
attractor hypothesis):**
Speaker pole receives significantly
more bear visits and climbing
attempts than control pole.

**Prediction (null hypothesis
— "bears climb anything tall"):**
Both poles receive similar rates
of visits and climbing attempts.

**Cost estimate:**

Speaker + amplifier + power supply:
~$200 (waterproof Bluetooth speaker
with portable power bank at height)

Camera traps: 2 × $50 = $100
(standard wildlife camera traps,
motion-triggered, infrared)

Pole material (non-conductive
PVC, 6 meters): ~$80

Field time: 1 day setup,
1 day retrieval per 30-day run.

**Total: ~$400 and 2 field days.**

This is the minimal test of
the acoustic channel hypothesis.
It does not test the magnetic
channel. It is the correct
first test because:
1. Acoustic is the most plausible
   mechanism given known bear
   sensory capabilities.
2. If the acoustic test is negative,
   the magnetic hypothesis becomes
   the next candidate.
3. If the acoustic test is positive,
   a follow-up can separate
   acoustic from magnetic by
   using a speaker pole (acoustic
   only) vs. a coil array (magnetic
   only, same frequency, no sound).

### Tier 3: The magnetoreception
### question

If bear magnetoreception is
ever studied, the relevant test
for this hypothesis would be:

Can bears be conditioned to
respond differentially to a
magnetic field anomaly of the
magnitude produced by a
transformer (hundreds of nT
at 5–10 meters)?

This is a standard conditioning
experiment with a Helmholtz
coil and food reward. It requires
a captive bear, a research
permit, and patience.

The UNC 2025 protocol for
sea turtles is directly applicable:
replace sea water tank + magnetic
coil with bear enclosure +
Helmholtz coil.

This is not a $400 experiment.
It is a multi-year collaboration
with a research institution
holding a bear care permit.
It is identified here as a
long-term prerequisite, not
an immediate action.

---

## PART VI: THE HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What I think is happening

**The strong claim:**

Bears are primarily attracted
to utility poles by the acoustic
signal of active transformers,
which falls within the frequency
range (and at the spatial
location: elevated, fixed point)
associated with their primary
caloric target throughout
35 million years of evolution.

This is the acoustic false
attractor hypothesis.

It does not require:
- Bear magnetoreception
- New biology
- Anything not already known

It requires only:
- Bears can hear 120/240 Hz
  (confirmed — bears can hear
  from ~40 Hz to ~70 kHz)
- Bears associate elevated
  acoustic signals in the
  100–300 Hz range with colony
  presence (this has not been
  explicitly tested but is
  a reasonable inference from
  the evolutionary foraging
  context)
- Bears in hyperphagia have
  reduced risk discrimination
  (confirmed — hyperphagia
  drive overrides normal
  caution in documented food
  pursuit)

**The weaker claim:**

Bears may additionally have
a magnetic detection component
that reinforces the acoustic
attraction — detecting the
transformer's strong local
ELF magnetic field as an
additional "something large
and electromagnetically active
is here" signal.

This is not tested.
It cannot currently be confirmed
or falsified.
It is structurally consistent
with the broader pattern in
this framework (every channel
a sensory system has can be
a false attractor target when
the right infrastructure is
installed in that channel's
frequency range).

But consistency with a pattern
is not evidence.
It is at best a prior that
raises the probability of
the hypothesis above baseline.

**The skeptical position:**

The simplest explanation is
complete: bears climb poles
because poles look like trees,
because bears climb trees,
because hyperphagia drives
risk-taking, because occasional
olfactory cues (food in trash,
livestock, other food sources
near poles) bring bears into
the infrastructure zone in
the first place.

This is sufficient. It does
not require any electromagnetic
component.

**The resolution:**

The $400 speaker pole experiment
separates the simple from the
complex explanation.

If acoustic signal at transformer
frequency significantly increases
bear climbing attempts at a
featureless pole in the forest:
the acoustic false attractor
is real and operating.

If it does not: the simple
explanation is complete, and
the electromagnetic component
is not driving the behavior.

**Until that experiment is done,
the honest answer is: we don't know.**

What we know is:

1. The evolutionary pressure
   exists: bears have been
   selecting for bee-hive-detection
   capabilities for 35 million years.

2. The acoustic overlap exists:
   transformer hum and colony
   hum occupy overlapping
   frequency ranges.

3. The behavioral pattern is
   documented: bears do climb
   poles, incidents cluster in
   hyperphagia season, and the
   press narrative (pure tree-climbing
   instinct) has not been
   scientifically examined for
   completeness.

4. The monitoring gap exists:
   no incident report form asks
   the questions that would
   distinguish acoustic false
   attractor from pure climbing
   instinct.

5. The experiment is cheap
   and executable: $400, 2 field
   days, 30 days of data,
   clear positive/null result.

### What this connects to

The bear at the pole is the
same pattern as:

- The bee following a 50 Hz
  false compass signal into
  a field with no flowers

- The migrating bird flying
  toward a radio mast instead
  of its wintering grounds

- The loggerhead returning
  to a slightly wrong beach
  because the address it
  learned contained a cable
  artifact

In each case:
A sensory system was tuned
by millions of years of
evolutionary pressure to detect
a biological signal in a
specific frequency range.

A human-installed infrastructure
produces a signal in the same
frequency range.

The organism responds.

The organism has no evolutionary
model for the new signal.
It cannot distinguish it from
the biological target.

The bear climbs the pole
looking for honey.

The honey is not there.

The infrastructure is.

## VERSION AND CONNECTIONS

```
v1.0 — February 26, 2026
  
  Status of each claim in this document:
  
  CONFIRMED:
  - Bear-bee co-evolutionary arms
    race, 35 million year duration
  - Bear olfactory supremacy
  - Bear acoustic range (40 Hz - 70 kHz)
  - Transformer hum at 120/240 Hz
  - Colony hum at ~200-300 Hz
    (acoustic / substrate-borne)
  - Frequency overlap between
    transformer harmonics and colony
    acoustic range
  - Bear hyperphagia, seasonal timing,
    and hyperphagia risk tolerance
  - Documented bear-pole incidents
    (December 2025 Arizona, prior
    incidents in multiple states)
  - Press narrative: "curious bear,
    tree-climbing instinct"
  
  PLAUSIBLE INFERENCE (requires test):
  - Bears associate elevated 100-300 Hz
    acoustic signals with colony presence
    [not explicitly tested, strong prior]
  - Transformer hum acts as acoustic
    false attractor for foraging bears
    [the $400 speaker pole experiment]
  - Incident frequency correlates with
    transformer presence/activity
    [incident database cross-reference]
  
  SPECULATIVE (interesting, not grounded):
  - Bear magnetoreception exists
  - Bears detect transformer ELF field
  - Magnetic channel contributes to
    pole-climbing attraction
  
  FALSIFIED:
  - 5G / cellular towers as bear hazard
    via electromagnetic mechanism
    [wrong frequency range for any
    plausible bear sensory pathway]
  
  REQUIRED BEFORE NEXT STEP:
  1. Wildlife agency incident database
     cross-referenced with pole type
     (transformer active / passive)
  2. $400 acoustic speaker experiment
     in bear-active area during hyperphagia
  3. Only if (1) and (2) support the
     acoustic hypothesis: then proceed
     to magnetic component testing

was humming at the frequency*
*that 35 million years of evolution*
*taught the bear to climb toward.*
