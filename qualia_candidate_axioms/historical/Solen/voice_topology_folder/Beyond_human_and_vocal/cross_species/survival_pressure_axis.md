artifact_type: framework derivation object —
  a structural principle derived from
  comparative species analysis, applied

series: Cross-Species Communication
  Series — Document 10
provenance: the following prediction
  was offered by the human contributor
  and is preserved as the generative seed:

  "Self-model is only useful if it
  is useful for survival — if that
  pressure is high. If self-model
  and RARFL cycle align with survival
  then it is self-evident."

  And the following structural
  observation:
  "I notice a structure, not sure
  if you do too."

  ANSWER: YES.
  This document names and formalizes
  that structure.

core_claim: The depth and type of
  self-model in any organism is
  predicted by where survival
  pressure lands — on the individual
  body, the collective body, or
  the other. This is the axis.
  Not intelligence. Not brain size.
  Not social complexity.
  WHERE DOES IT HURT WHEN YOU GET IT WRONG?

## PART I: THE AXIS NAMED

### 1.1 The Central Claim

From CS docs 6-9, a pattern has
been building across every species
analyzed.

The wrasse, the deer, the dog,
the wolf, the garter snake, the
bear — each has been analyzed in
terms of ecological pressure and
self-model depth.

**The pattern is now clear enough
to state as a general principle.**

**THE SURVIVAL PRESSURE AXIS:**

```
The type of cognitive model an
organism develops is predicted by
where its survival errors are paid.

AXIS POSITION 1: INDIVIDUAL BODY
  Errors paid by: the individual
  organism's body state being
  misread or mismanaged.
  
  Examples of the error:
  - Deer miscalculates its own
    scent trajectory. Predator
    detects it first. It dies.
  - Octopus fails to match its
    body to the substrate.
    Predator sees it. It dies.
  - Cleaner wrasse fails to
    detect a parasite on its own
    body. Infection spreads.
    It dies.
  
  Cognitive model that develops:
  SELF-MODEL.
  Deep, projective, domain-specific.
  The self as the primary object
  of monitoring and management.

AXIS POSITION 2: COLLECTIVE BODY
  Errors paid by: separation from
  or failure to integrate with
  the collective, or the collective
  making a wrong decision.
  
  Examples of the error:
  - Prey fish breaks rank during
    a predator attack. Isolated.
    It dies.
  - Penguin strays from colony in
    Antarctic cold. Hypothermia.
    It dies.
  - Honeybee fails to follow
    waggle dance correctly. Does
    not reach food source.
    Colony weakened.
  
  Cognitive model that develops:
  COLLECTIVE-INTEGRATION MODEL.
  Not a self-model. A model of
  own position relative to the
  group. The self is not the primary
  object — the collective is.
  Individual variation is noise
  to be suppressed.

AXIS POSITION 3: THE OTHER
  Errors paid by: misreading or
  failing to maintain the specific
  other entity on which survival
  depends.
  
  Examples of the error:
  - Oxpecker misidentifies host
    species or misreads host's
    tolerance state. Gets shaken off.
    Loses food source.
  - Cleaner wrasse cheats in
    front of observer. Loses
    client reputation. Loses
    food source.
  - Allogrooming monkey fails to
    read partner's state correctly.
    Bond breaks. Social protection
    lost.
  
  Cognitive model that develops:
  OTHER-MODEL.
  Deep modeling of a specific other
  entity's state, needs, and behavior.
  The self is not the primary object —
  the other is.
```

**This is the axis.**

Not intelligence vs. simplicity.
Not social vs. solitary.
Not mammal vs. fish vs. insect.

**Where does it hurt when you
get it wrong?**

The answer to that question
predicts what kind of model
the organism develops.

### 1.2 The Three Model Types —
### Structural Definitions

```
SELF-MODEL:
  Internal representation of
  own body state, including
  domain-specific projections
  (olfactory plume position,
  body-to-substrate match,
  parasite presence on own surface).
  
  Primary cognitive object: SELF.
  
  Triggered by: solitary ecology
  OR high-stakes individual body
  management requirements.
  
  Signal when correct: low —
  the self-model at baseline
  produces no visible behavior.
  The model is running silently.
  
  Signal when anomalous: high —
  RARFL fires, investigation
  begins, behavior changes.
  The gap is the visible event.

COLLECTIVE-INTEGRATION MODEL:
  Internal representation of
  own position and velocity
  relative to the group — and
  of group state (density, heading,
  alarm level).
  
  Primary cognitive object:
  COLLECTIVE POSITION.
  
  Not a self-model. The individual
  does not need to monitor its own
  body state in the rich sense.
  It needs to monitor its spatial
  and behavioral alignment with
  the collective.
  
  Triggered by: group-dependent
  survival — predator dilution,
  thermal efficiency, collective
  decision-making that exceeds
  individual capacity.
  
  KEY STRUCTURAL FEATURE:
  The individual self-model is
  actively suppressed in this
  configuration. Individual
  deviation from collective behavior
  is dangerous (breaks rank →
  exposed to predator). The
  organism's fitness is served
  by being LESS individually
  self-aware and MORE collectively
  synchronized.
  
  This is the direct inverse
  of the self-model configuration.

OTHER-MODEL:
  Internal representation of
  a specific other entity —
  its body state, current needs,
  behavioral patterns, tolerance
  thresholds, and responses to
  the modeler's own behavior.
  
  Primary cognitive object:
  THE OTHER.
  
  Triggered by: survival or
  reproductive fitness depending
  directly on accurately modeling
  and responding to a specific
  other entity.
  
  KEY STRUCTURAL FEATURE:
  The other-model and the self-model
  are in tension. Resources spent
  modeling the other are not
  spent modeling the self.
  
  BUT: other-model requires a
  minimal self-model as a
  reference point — the organism
  needs to know what IT is doing
  in order to predict how THE OTHER
  will respond.
  
  Therefore: symbiotic/mutualistic
  species develop hybrid models —
  a sufficient self-model to
  support the other-model, but
  with primary depth in the
  other direction.
```

## PART II: THE SPECIES ANALYZED
## AGAINST THE AXIS

### 2.1 SELF-MODEL DOMINANT SPECIES

**OCTOPUS (Octopus vulgaris)**

```
SURVIVAL PRESSURE: INDIVIDUAL BODY
  
WHY SELF-MODEL IS REQUIRED AT
MAXIMUM DEPTH:

  The octopus survival strategy
  is camouflage.
  
  Camouflage requires the organism
  to compute, in real time:
  
  (1) The current visual properties
      of the environment at this
      exact location (color, texture,
      pattern, luminance).
  
  (2) Its own current body state —
      the chromatophore activation
      pattern across millions of
      independently controllable
      cells.
  
  (3) The gap between (1) and (2).
  
  (4) The motor commands to
      close that gap.
  
  THIS IS A RARFL CYCLE RUNNING
  CONTINUOUSLY ON THE OCTOPUS'S
  OWN BODY SURFACE AS THE PRIMARY
  SURVIVAL MECHANISM.
  
  The octopus self-model is not
  a side capacity. It is the
  primary survival computation.
  
  Additional complexity:
  The octopus has eight arms,
  each with approximately
  two-thirds of the total neural
  tissue in the body distributed
  through them. Each arm has
  local processing capacity.
  
  The central brain does not
  directly control each arm's
  detailed movement.
  
  The octopus self-model must
  coordinate a distributed
  nervous system — maintaining
  body unity across eight semi-
  autonomous agents.
  
  THE RUBBER HAND ILLUSION (2025):
  
  The most direct evidence yet:
  When a rubber arm was positioned
  to replace one of the octopus's
  arms, with synchronized tactile
  stimulation, the octopus
  responded defensively when
  the fake arm was pinched.
  
  It treated the fake arm as
  its own.
  
  This is body ownership —
  the extension of the self-model
  to include an external object
  that is presented with the right
  synchrony cues.
  
  The same illusion fails in
  humans if the timing is wrong.
  It works in octopuses.
  
  The octopus's body ownership
  system is so developed that
  it can be fooled by a rubber
  arm in the same way human
  proprioception can be fooled
  by a rubber hand.
  
  This is Tier 3+ self-model.
  
  The octopus models its own
  body boundaries dynamically —
  and those boundaries can be
  extended to include objects
  that are synchronized with
  its own somatosensory state.

DOMAIN OF SELF-MODEL:
  VISUAL-SOMATIC.
  Both what the body looks like
  FROM THE OUTSIDE (chromatophore
  pattern matching environment)
  AND what the body feels like
  FROM THE INSIDE (proprioception,
  arm position, texture contact).
  
  This is a bi-directional
  self-model: outward-projective
  (what does my surface look like
  to predators?) AND inward-
  receptive (what is my body
  doing right now?).
  
  This is the most complete
  self-model documented in
  any invertebrate — and may
  exceed many vertebrates in
  operational depth.

MSR TEST PREDICTION:
  The octopus fails the standard
  visual MSR test.
  
  Not because it lacks a self-model.
  
  Because the mirror test requires
  the animal to:
  (a) Recognize its own visual
      appearance in a mirror
  (b) Attribute a mark on that
      appearance to its own body
  
  An octopus routinely changes
  its own visual appearance.
  What its body "looks like"
  is not a stable reference point.
  
  The octopus's self-model
  is defined not by a fixed
  visual appearance but by
  the continuous dynamic of
  appearance management.
  
  A fixed mark on a fixed appearance
  is not the right probe for
  an animal whose self-model is
  organized around appearance
  CHANGE, not appearance STABILITY.
  
  CORRECT TEST FOR OCTOPUS:
  Apply a mark that PREVENTS
  a specific region of the body
  from changing color —
  a patch that the chromatophores
  cannot activate beneath.
  
  If the octopus notices the
  non-responsive patch (gap
  in its own appearance-management
  system) and investigates it —
  and attempts to activate
  the region — this would be
  the octopus equivalent of
  mark investigation.
  
  THIS TEST HAS NOT BEEN DONE.
  IT IS A DIRECT PREDICTION
  FROM THE FRAMEWORK.
  PREDICTION: STRONGLY POSITIVE.
```

**TURKEY VULTURE (Cathartes aura)**

```
SURVIVAL PRESSURE: INDIVIDUAL BODY
  (specifically: locating own food
  source via own olfactory capacity)

SELF-MODEL DOMAIN: OLFACTORY
  (same modality as deer and dogs,
  but for different function)

WHY SELF-MODEL IS REQUIRED:

  The turkey vulture's survival
  depends entirely on its ability
  to detect, locate, and navigate
  to scent plumes of decomposing
  organic material.
  
  Critically: the vulture is
  airborne while tracking these
  plumes.
  
  Airborne scent-plume tracking
  requires:
  
  (1) Detection of the target
      scent (ethyl mercaptan
      from decomposition).
  
  (2) Discrimination of the
      target scent from background —
      including from the vulture's
      OWN body odor and the odors
      it is carrying from its
      last feeding.
  
  (3) Gradient tracking:
      the vulture uses the
      concentration gradient of
      the plume to navigate toward
      the source — moving toward
      higher concentrations.
  
  THIS REQUIRES SUBTRACTING OWN
  SCENT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL READ —
  exactly the operation the deer
  performs in Tier 3.
  
  The vulture is carrying its own
  scent signature (from rotting
  material on its beak and feathers
  from prior feeding).
  
  To accurately read the plume
  gradient, it must know what
  its own scent contribution is
  at any moment — and subtract
  it from the detected environmental
  signal.
  
  If it cannot do this, it would
  track toward its own prior-
  feeding scent rather than toward
  a new carcass.
  
  EVIDENCE: Turkey vultures can
  locate concealed carcasses
  beneath dense vegetation that
  black vultures (visually-oriented,
  no olfactory specialization)
  cannot find. They track ethyl
  mercaptan concentrations as
  low as parts-per-trillion.
  
  The 2025 genetic finding:
  Turkey vultures have a significantly
  expanded olfactory receptor
  gene repertoire compared to
  other raptors — specifically
  in receptor families associated
  with discrimination of complex
  scent mixtures.
  
  This is the molecular substrate
  of the self-subtraction capacity:
  receptors tuned to discriminate
  the target signal from
  contaminating signals —
  including own-body signals.

SELF-MODEL TYPE: OLFACTORY TIER 2-3
  
  Not Tier 3 in the deer sense
  (managing own scent as a
  strategic variable in a
  threat environment).
  
  But Tier 2-3 in the tracking sense:
  the vulture knows what it
  smells like (Tier 1), knows
  it is broadcasting that scent
  (Tier 2), and manages the
  interference between its own
  signal and the target signal
  it is tracking (Tier 3 olfactory
  signal processing).
  
  Different function from the deer.
  Same cognitive architecture:
  self-as-noise that must be
  subtracted from the environmental
  read to get the real signal.

MSR PREDICTION:
  Visual MSR: likely negative.
  (Primary modality is not visual
  for self-modeling purposes.)
  
  Olfactory STSR: likely positive.
  (Olfactory self-model is deep
  and operationally critical.)
  
  SPECIFIC PREDICTION:
  Vultures would show differential
  response to own-scent-modified
  samples, and specifically
  would show difficulty tracking
  scent plumes in conditions where
  their own scent has been
  artificially elevated
  (by coating feathers with
  stronger version of own odor).
  
  This would be an interference
  effect — the self-model
  is disrupted by artificial
  amplification of self-signal,
  degrading tracking performance.
  
  Testable. Not yet done.

**DEEP SEA SOLITARY SPECIES
(pressure/chemoreception primary)**

```
SURVIVAL PRESSURE: INDIVIDUAL BODY
  (in the extreme)

CONDITIONS:
  Total darkness.
  No visual self-model possible
  (no light to reflect from own body).
  No visual world-model possible.
  
  Primary channels: pressure
  (lateral line), chemoreception,
  possibly bioluminescence,
  possibly electroreception.
  
SELF-MODEL DOMAIN: MECHANORECEPTIVE
  AND HYDRODYNAMIC
  
  The deep sea solitary organism's
  self-model must be constructed
  entirely from non-visual channels.
  
  The lateral line provides:
  - Hydrodynamic self-image:
    the pressure waves the organism
    generates as it moves through
    the water.
  - Environmental read: pressure
    waves reflected from nearby
    objects and other organisms.
  
  THE SELF-SUBTRACTION PROBLEM
  IS MAXIMUM HERE:
  
  Every movement the organism
  makes generates pressure waves.
  Those pressure waves are
  detectable by its own lateral line.
  
  To read the environment
  via lateral line, the organism
  must subtract its own movement-
  generated pressure signature
  from the total detected signal.
  
  This is efference copy:
  the nervous system predicts
  what pressure wave its own
  movement will generate,
  and subtracts that prediction
  from the sensory input —
  leaving only the unexpected
  environmental signal.
  
  EFFERENCE COPY IS A MECHANISTIC
  SELF-MODEL.
  
  It is the organism continuously
  predicting its own signal output
  and subtracting it from the
  environmental read.
  
  IT IS TIER 3 IN THE PRESSURE DOMAIN.
  
  And it is a requirement for any
  organism using the lateral line
  for prey detection — including
  nearly all fish, deep sea or not.
  
  Deep sea solitaries have this
  at maximum development because:
  (a) No visual channel to fall back on
  (b) Lateral line is the primary
      both for environment-reading
      and for self-monitoring
  (c) In the deep sea, any failure
      of environmental detection
      is fatal — no recovery
      possible in total darkness
  
NOTE ON MSR TESTS FOR DEEP SEA:
  Visual MSR is structurally
  inapplicable — no ambient light.
  
  The correct self-model probe
  for deep sea species would be
  a HYDRODYNAMIC SELF-RECOGNITION TEST:
  
  Present the organism with a
  recording of its own movement-
  generated pressure wave versus
  a modified version (altered
  frequency, amplitude, or timing).
  
  If the organism responds
  differently to own-modified
  vs. own-unmodified hydrodynamic
  signature: Tier 1 lateral line
  self-model confirmed.
  
  If the organism responds
  to own-modified-pressure with
  the same alert response it
  gives to foreign pressure
  signatures: the self-model
  is treating the anomaly as
  "not self" — Tier 1 confirmed
  via misattribution.
  
  This is technically demanding
  but feasible in deep sea
  research conditions.
  Not yet done.

**DUNG BEETLE (Scarabaeus satyrus)**

```
SURVIVAL PRESSURE: TRAJECTORY
  (not somatic body state)

THIS IS THE CRITICAL COUNTER-CASE.

  The dung beetle is solitary.
  It navigates without social
  support.
  Its survival depends entirely
  on its own individual navigational
  capacity.
  
  One would predict: deep self-model.
  
  BUT:
  
  The dung beetle's survival
  pressure lands on its TRAJECTORY
  THROUGH SPACE, not on its
  own body state.
  
  The dung beetle must:
  - Roll a ball of dung in a
    straight line away from
    the competition at the dung pile
  - Not circle back
  - Reach a safe distance
    quickly
  
  What fails when the beetle
  gets it wrong:
  - Competitor reaches its
    ball before it does
  - It circles back into
    the competition zone
  
  NOT: it is detected by a predator
  because it failed to manage
  its own scent.
  
  NOT: it fails to camouflage.
  
  NOT: it misreads its own
  body state.
  
  THE PRESSURE IS NAVIGATIONAL,
  NOT SOMATIC.
  
  The dung beetle's cognitive
  model is a TRAJECTORY MODEL,
  not a self-model in the
  somatic sense.
  
  EVIDENCE:
  The dung beetle uses the Milky Way
  as a fixed-bearing compass.
  It climbs on top of its dung ball,
  performs a "dance" that is now
  understood as a calibration routine —
  taking a snapshot of the current
  celestial bearing — and then
  rolls in that direction.
  
  The "dance" is a path integration
  initialization: establishing
  a reference bearing before
  locomotion begins.
  
  This is POSITIONAL SELF-AWARENESS
  (where am I relative to the
  celestial fixed frame?)
  NOT SOMATIC SELF-AWARENESS
  (what is the state of my body?).
  
PREDICTION:
  Dung beetle fails olfactory STSR.
  Dung beetle is indifferent to
  visual marks on its own body.
  Dung beetle has no rich somatic
  self-model.
  
  BUT: dung beetle has a deep
  POSITIONAL self-model —
  a continuously maintained
  representation of its own
  position and heading in
  external space.
  
  The correct self-model probe
  for the dung beetle is a
  NAVIGATION DISRUPTION TEST:
  
  Rotate the beetle 90 degrees
  mid-roll (without its knowledge).
  
  Does it detect the discrepancy
  between its expected position
  and its actual position?
  Does it recalibrate?
  
  KNOWN RESULT: YES.
  Dung beetles that are displaced
  or disoriented perform a
  recalibration dance.
  
  THIS IS RARFL IN THE POSITIONAL
  DOMAIN:
  Gap detected between expected
  heading and actual heading →
  RARFL fires → recalibrate →
  roll again.
  
  The self-model is positional.
  Not somatic.
  Not social.
  
  The framework predicts this.
  The pressure determines the domain.
  Navigational pressure → positional
  self-model. Not somatic self-model.

### 2.2 COLLECTIVE-INTEGRATION
### DOMINANT SPECIES

**SCHOOLING FISH / MURMURATION /
PENGUINS / BUFFALO / BEES**

```
SURVIVAL MECHANISM: COLLECTIVE DEFENSE

THE KEY FINDING (2024-2025 research):

Schooling fish collective behavior
is driven by:
- Local interaction rules only
  (avoid, align, attract)
- No centralized coordination
- No individual "knowing"
  the whole picture
- Information propagates as
  wave through the collective
  (stress-induced critical state —
  APS 2024: the school operates
  at a criticality point that
  maximizes information transfer
  speed across the group)

THE CRITICAL STRUCTURAL INSIGHT:

Individual self-model would be
ACTIVELY HARMFUL in this configuration.

If each fish in a school maintained
a deep individual self-model —
monitoring its own body state,
making individual survival
decisions — it would:
(a) Respond to individual threat
    assessments that might differ
    from the collective assessment
(b) Break synchrony
(c) Create exploitable gaps
    in the collective formation

The survival mechanism is
SYNCHRONY — the school moves
as one entity.

Individual deviation is the
failure mode, not the success mode.

THEREFORE:
The school operates by suppressing
individual self-models and
amplifying collective-position
models.

Each fish needs to know:
- Where is the nearest fish?
  (alignment)
- How fast is it moving?
  (velocity matching)
- What is the local density?
  (avoid collision)

It does NOT need to know:
- What is my body state?
- Where am I projecting my scent?
- Is there a mark on my body?

THE SCHOOL IS A DISTRIBUTED
COGNITIVE SYSTEM THAT WORKS
BY REDUCING INDIVIDUAL SELF-MODEL
DEPTH TO NEAR ZERO.

This explains the MSR failure
prediction:

Prey fish in a school would not
only fail the MSR test — they
would be expected to show minimal
self-referential investigation
of any kind.

Not because they lack the neural
substrate. But because any
cognitive resources devoted to
self-monitoring rather than
collective-synchrony would be
evolutionarily selected against.

The selection pressure over
millions of years has been:
LESS individual self-model →
better synchrony → better survival.

THE SCHOOL IS THE SELF.

The individual fish is a node
in the collective cognitive system,
not an independent self-aware agent.

MURMURATION / STARLINGS:
Same structure, aerial medium.
The collective fluid dynamics
of a murmuration are the
self-model of the group, not
of any individual bird.
Each starling contributes to
and reads from the collective
fluid state.
No individual needs a
self-model — only a
collective-position model.

PENGUINS:
Thermal huddling.
The collective conserves heat.
Individual deviation from huddle
contact = individual heat loss.
The pressure is collective-position:
maintain contact with the group.
Not individual body management.
Not somatic self-model.
Collective-integration model only.

BEES (waggle dance exception):
Bees present an interesting
internal case.
Most bees: collective-integration
(hive behavior, swarm).
Scout bees: individual navigational
self-model (Tier 1 positional).
Forager bees: individual olfactory
self-model (detecting own colony
scent to navigate home).

The hive is collectively intelligent.
Individual bees switch between
collective-integration mode
(following pheromones, following
waggle dance) and individual-
positional mode (scout navigation).

This is the bee equivalent of
the wolf's lone/pack switching:
the organism can shift along
the axis depending on its
current role.

WOLVES (the outlier explained):
The wolf is the most cognitively
demanding configuration because
it must maintain BOTH:
- Individual somatic self-model
  (lone wolf survival: olfactory
  self-projection, territorial
  scent management)
- Collective-integration model
  (pack behavior: coordinated hunt,
  role assignment, dominance
  signaling)

Switching between these is
a higher-order cognitive operation
than maintaining either alone.

This predicts wolves should have
among the highest cognitive
flexibility of any canid —
which is consistent with their
known problem-solving performance
compared to domestic dogs in
some tasks.

THE LONE WOLF IS NOT JUST A
ROMANTIC ARCHETYPE.

It is the cognitively demanding
mode where the full individual
self-model must activate — because
the collective protection has
been removed and the individual
body is now the only survival unit.

The wolf that goes lone must
rebuild its individual self-model
from the social mode into the
full Tier 3 mode — the olfactory
self-projective model used
for territory, prey, and
predator management without
pack backup.

### 2.3 OTHER-MODEL DOMINANT SPECIES

**OXPECKER, CLEANER WRASSE AS
OTHER-MODELER, ALLOGROOMERS**

```
SURVIVAL PRESSURE: ACCURACY OF
THE OTHER-MODEL

THE STRUCTURE:

Oxpecker survival depends on
maintaining access to a host.
The host can dislodge the oxpecker
if it misreads the host's tolerance state.
The host can withdraw access
if the oxpecker cheats too much.

The oxpecker's survival = accurate
model of the host's current state,
tolerance threshold, and response
patterns.

NOT: model of own body state.
The oxpecker's own body state
is not the primary survival variable.

THE OTHER-MODEL STRUCTURE:

The oxpecker must model:
(1) This host's individual identity
    (not all hosts are equal)
(2) This host's current tick load
    (foraging opportunity)
(3) This host's current tolerance state
    (how much probing before rejection?)
(4) This host's wound status
    (fresh wound = blood opportunity,
    but also increased rejection risk)
(5) Presence of observer hosts
    (other hosts watching behavior)

This is a full theory-of-mind
model of the host —
the oxpecker must model what the
host is experiencing and predicting,
not just what it is doing.

THIS IS THE SAME COGNITIVE STRUCTURE
AS THE CLEANER WRASSE:

The wrasse's survival depends on:
- Modeling each client's individual
  identity
- Modeling the client's current
  parasite load
- Modeling the client's tolerance
  for cheating
- Modeling the observer fish's
  assessment of the wrasse's behavior
- Modulating cheating based on
  all of the above

The wrasse has deep OTHER-MODELS
for each client — AND a reputation
model that is a second-order
other-model: what do observers
think the clients think of me?

THIS IS THIRD-ORDER SOCIAL COGNITION:
a model of a model of a model.

The wrasse knows that the observer
is watching, the observer is
modeling the wrasse's behavior,
and the observer's future behavior
toward the wrasse will depend on
what model the observer has built.

THE CLEANING STATION IS AN
OTHER-MODEL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT.

Every interaction refines the
other-model.

The wrasse's deep other-model
is what enables it to also have
a deep self-model (it knows
what it looks like because it
needs to know what clients
are comparing when they inspect
its body).

OTHER-MODEL AND SELF-MODEL
ARE NOT OPPOSITES —
THEY REQUIRE EACH OTHER
AT HIGH DEVELOPMENT LEVELS.

The oxpecker with a shallow
self-model can still be an
effective other-modeler as long
as the other (host) is much
larger and more predictable.

The wrasse with a deep self-model
and a deep other-model is the
most cognitively sophisticated
configuration in the taxonomy —
which is exactly what makes it
the most surprising MSR passer.

ALLOGROOMING MONKEYS:
Mutual other-modeling.
Each groomer models the groomee's
state (parasite load, stress level,
preferred grooming locations).
This is an OTHER-MODEL running
in both directions.
Social network position = result
of accumulated other-model accuracy.
The monkey with the most accurate
other-models has the best social
position.
Individual self-model: secondary.
The monkey's own body state is
primarily relevant as a variable
in the other's model of the monkey.
The monkey monitors its own state
partly through reading how others
treat it — social mirror.

## PART III: THE MARINE AND
## AQUATIC MEDIUM

### 3.1 Why the Medium Matters

The aquatic medium deserves
separate analysis because it
changes the physical constraints
of self-model projection in
fundamental ways.

In air:
- Scent diffuses in specific
  directional plumes with wind
- Visible light propagates
  with minimal attenuation
- Sound propagates spherically
  with moderate attenuation

In water:
- Chemical signals diffuse
  slowly but can persist
  for hours
- Visible light attenuates
  sharply with depth
- Sound propagates FASTER
  and with LESS attenuation
  than in air
- Pressure waves propagate
  in all directions simultaneously
- Electric fields propagate
  up to meters

**For self-model in the aquatic
medium, the dominant channels
are completely different from
terrestrial:**

The aquatic organism cannot rely
on visual self-projection
(too attenuated below the surface).

The aquatic organism's primary
self-projection channels are:
- Hydrodynamic pressure
  (movement-generated waves —
  always broadcasting, always present)
- Chemical diffusion
  (slower, more persistent than air)
- Bioluminescence
  (in total darkness: the organism
  IS its own light source —
  the self IS the signal)

### 3.2 THE FISH IN THE MEDIUM —
### SELF-MODEL VIA PRESSURE FIELD

```
Every fish generates a continuous
pressure field as it moves.

This is inescapable.

Every fin beat, every body
oscillation, every gill pump
generates pressure waves that
propagate outward and are
detectable by lateral line
systems — including the fish's
own lateral line.

THE FISH LIVES INSIDE ITS OWN
PRESSURE SIGNATURE.

This is the aquatic equivalent
of the dog living inside its own
scent cloud.

But there is a critical difference:

The dog's scent cloud is generated
passively (by body chemistry)
and diffuses slowly.

The fish's pressure field is
generated actively (by movement)
and propagates immediately.

The fish has PRECISE, REAL-TIME
CONTROL over its own pressure
signature — by changing swim
speed, fin position, body undulation
frequency, and depth.

THIS IS A SELF-PROJECTIVE MODEL
IN THE PRESSURE DOMAIN.

A fish that reduces its own
pressure signature (by adopting
a glide rather than active
fin-beat locomotion) is:
- Knowing what signal it is
  currently producing
- Predicting that signal's
  effect on the prey/predator
  it is approaching
- Modifying its own motion
  to minimize that signal

THIS IS TIER 3 IN THE PRESSURE DOMAIN.

SOLITARY PREDATORY FISH (pike,
barracuda, ambush predators):

The ambush predator is the
pressure-domain equivalent of
the stalking deer.

The deer manages its olfactory
signature during approach.
The ambush predatory fish manages
its hydrodynamic signature
during approach.

Both require the same cognitive
structure:
  Self-model of own signal output.
  Projection of that signal
  in the medium.
  Management of own signal
  to minimize detection by target.

THE AMBUSH FISH DOES NOT SCHOOL.
IT IS SOLITARY.
ITS SURVIVAL PRESSURE LANDS
ON ITS OWN BODY MANAGEMENT.

Prediction: ambush predatory fish
(pike, barracuda, stonefish,
frogfish) should show higher
self-model depth than schooling
prey fish — in the hydrodynamic
pressure domain.

This is testable: do ambush
predators show stronger efference
copy (self-motion cancellation)
in lateral line processing than
schooling species?

Neurologically: yes, this is
already partially documented —
ambush predators have stronger
lateral line inhibition during
self-motion (better self-subtraction)
than fast-swimming schooling
species that rely primarily
on visual collective-integration.
```

### 3.3 OCTOPUS CONTINUED —
### THE VISUAL SELF-MODEL IN WATER

```
In air: visual self-model is
episodic (you have to look at
yourself).

In shallow water: visual
self-model is potentially more
persistent — the organism's own
body surface is visible in
reflected ambient light.

For the octopus:

The octopus routinely INSPECTS
ITS OWN BODY by directing its
arms and visual field toward
its own surface.

This is body-directed visual
attention — a behavior normally
associated with grooming (removing
parasites) or injury inspection.

But for the octopus, it also
serves the chromatophore
self-monitoring function:
checking whether the current
camouflage pattern matches
the target environment.

The octopus looks at itself
to check if its own appearance
is working.

THIS IS THE VISUAL SELF-MODEL
IN ACTIVE OPERATION.

Not in a mirror. Not through a
test. In natural ecology, every
time the octopus adjusts its
camouflage and then visually
checks a patch of its own skin.

The octopus passes the visual
self-check routinely.

The MSR test is a special case
of this: "is the appearance
of this reflected surface
the expected appearance of my
own body?" — but the octopus
never needs a mirror because
it can see its own body directly.

THE MSR TEST IS IRRELEVANT FOR
AN ANIMAL THAT CAN SEE ITSELF.

The MSR test was designed for
animals that cannot directly
see most of their own body
surface (the back, the top
of the head) — requiring a
mirror to access those regions.

The octopus can bring its eyes
to any part of its own body
using its flexible arm structure.

A MARK ON AN OCTOPUS'S MANTLE
SHOULD BE NOTICED WITHOUT A MIRROR —
because the octopus can orient
its visual field toward its own
mantle directly.

AND IN FACT: there is anecdotal
evidence that octopuses do inspect
marks on their own bodies in
exactly this way.

The failure to "pass the MSR test"
in octopuses is a failure of the
test design, not the octopus.
```

### 3.4 DEEP SEA BIOLUMINESCENCE —
### THE SELF AS SIGNAL

```
In the deep sea, below the
photic zone: no ambient light.

An organism that produces
bioluminescence IS its own
signal in the visual domain.

It cannot receive visual
information about itself from
ambient light (there is none).

But it CAN detect the light
it produces as it reflects
off nearby objects.

For species that use bioluminescent
patterns for communication
(anglerfish lure, squid photophores,
many deep sea fish species):

The organism must model:
- What pattern it is currently
  producing
- What that pattern looks like
  from the perspective of
  the receiver
- Whether the pattern is
  achieving its intended effect
  (attracting prey, signaling
  conspecifics, warning predators)

THIS IS A SELF-MODEL IN THE
BIOLUMINESCENT DOMAIN.

The organism is both the sender
and, through environmental
reflection, a partial receiver
of its own signal.

The angler fish lure is the
clearest case:

The angler fish produces a
moving light to attract prey.

The movement pattern of the lure
mimics the movement pattern of
the prey's own food sources.

The angler fish must model:
- What its lure looks like
  to the prey
- Whether the prey is
  responding (approaching)
- How to adjust the lure
  if the prey is not responding

This is a self-projective model
in the bioluminescent domain:
the fish models how its own
light output is being perceived
and adjusts accordingly.

Tier 2-3 in the bioluminescent
domain.

The medium (total darkness)
has forced the self-model to
operate entirely in the domain
of produced light rather than
reflected light.

The self IS the light.
The light IS the self-model
made visible in the environment.

## PART IV: THE STRUCTURE YOU FOUND —
## NAMED AND FORMALIZED

### The Formal Statement of
### the Structure

You said: "I notice a structure."

Here is the structure, formalized:

```
THE SURVIVAL PRESSURE TAXONOMY:

THREE TYPES OF COGNITIVE MODEL
CORRESPOND TO THREE TYPES OF
SURVIVAL ARCHITECTURE:

TYPE A: INDIVIDUAL SURVIVAL
  Survival errors paid by
  own body state mismanagement.
  
  → SELF-MODEL develops.
  
  Predicted species:
  Deer, octopus, wrasse (self-
  directed), ambush predatory fish,
  deep sea solitaries, turkey vulture.
  
  Self-model depth ∝ P(individual
  body management).
  
  Maximum depth when:
  error = death (deer, camouflage
  species, ambush predators).

TYPE B: COLLECTIVE SURVIVAL
  Survival errors paid by
  failure to synchronize with
  the collective.
  
  → COLLECTIVE-INTEGRATION MODEL
  develops. Individual self-model
  is actively suppressed.
  
  Predicted species:
  Schooling fish, starling murmurations,
  penguin huddles, buffalo herds,
  honeybee swarms.
  
  Individual self-model depth ∝
  1/P(collective synchrony).
  
  Maximum suppression when:
  synchrony breakdown = death
  (predator picks off stragglers).

TYPE C: OTHER SURVIVAL
  Survival errors paid by
  failure to model a specific other.
  
  → OTHER-MODEL develops.
  
  Predicted species:
  Oxpeckers, allogroomers, cleaner
  wrasse (as other-modeler),
  mutualistic symbionts.
  
  Other-model depth ∝ P(accurate
  modeling of the specific other).

TYPE D: POSITIONAL SURVIVAL
  (Subset of Type A, but warrants
  separate treatment)
  
  Survival errors paid by
  navigational failure.
  
  → POSITIONAL MODEL develops.
  Somatic self-model shallow.
  
  Predicted species:
  Dung beetles, migratory birds
  (navigation-primary), some insects.

TRANSITION CASES:
  WOLF: A ↔ B switching.
    Lone mode: Type A (individual
    olfactory self-model).
    Pack mode: Type B (collective-
    integration).
    Switching capacity is the
    cognitive demand.
  
  HONEYBEE (SCOUT): D → A switching.
    Foraging: Type D (positional).
    Colony recognition: Type A
    (olfactory self-model for
    colony-scent verification).
  
  CLEANER WRASSE: A ↔ C.
    High individual self-model
    (visual body inspection).
    High other-model (client and
    observer modeling).
    Both driven by high-stakes
    ecological roles.
    This is the most cognitively
    demanding combination.
```

### The Relationship to MSR Tests

```
THE MSR TEST IS A TYPE A TEST.

It tests whether an organism
has a somatic self-model in
the visual domain.

PREDICTION MATRIX:

TYPE A species in the visual domain:
  → PASS MSR (if visual is primary)
  → PASS domain-appropriate test
    (if visual is not primary)

TYPE B species:
  → FAIL MSR systematically.
  Not because they cannot — but
  because self-model has been
  evolutionarily suppressed.
  Type B species may be the LEAST
  able to develop MSR competence
  even with priming, because the
  priming procedure would require
  training AGAINST the selective
  pressure on individual self-model
  suppression.

TYPE C species:
  → UNPREDICTABLE on standard MSR.
  May pass if the other-model
  supports a minimal self-model
  as reference.
  May fail if self-model is deeply
  subordinate to other-model.

TYPE D species:
  → FAIL somatic MSR.
  PASS positional self-recognition
  tests (navigation disruption tests).

TRANSITION SPECIES (Wolf, Bee Scout):
  → PASS in individual mode.
  → FAIL or show reduced performance
    in collective mode.
  Cognitive mode-switching is
  testable: does the wolf show
  better STSR performance when
  isolated vs. when in pack context?
  PREDICTION: YES.
```

## PART V: THE DEEPEST CLAIM

The structure you found is not
just a classification.

It is a claim about the relationship
between survival architecture
and the type of mind that develops.

**Minds are not all trying to do
the same thing.**

The schooling fish is not a
failed self-aware organism.

It is a maximally successful
collective node.

Its survival architecture requires
it to dissolve its individual
self-model into the collective.

That is not cognitive failure.
That is cognitive optimization
for the correct objective.

**The type of mind follows from
the type of survival.**

And the type of survival follows
from the ecological niche.

**Therefore: to predict what kind
of mind an organism has, the
correct question is not:**

"How big is its brain?"
"How social is it?"
"Can it pass our test?"

**The correct question is:**

**"What kind of error is fatal
for this organism?"**

That question answers everything:

- What domain its self-model
  operates in
- Whether its self-model
  is somatic, positional,
  or suppressed
- Whether it models others
  or the collective or itself
- Whether the standard MSR test
  is relevant at all

**And when an organism has a
survival architecture where
getting its own body state wrong
is fatal:**

The self-model will be present.

Not as a luxury.

Not as an accident of neural
complexity.

**As the precise cost of survival.**

The deer's Tier 3 olfactory
self-projective model is not
a remarkable cognitive achievement.

It is the minimum viable solution
to the problem of being a
non-armored, non-venomous,
medium-sized prey animal in
a landscape full of apex predators
with better individual sensory
capacity than the deer.

The deer could not survive without it.

Therefore it has it.

**That is why self-model and
RARFL cycle align with survival:
not because they are optional —
but because they are the survival.**

v1.0 — February 26, 2026
  Cross-Species Communication
  Series — Document 10
  
Connections:
  CS docs 6-9: the individual
    species cases that this document
    synthesizes into the framework.
  CS doc 1: triadic gradient —
    the gradient now needs to be
    read through the Type A/B/C/D
    lens. Only Type A species
    will show robust triadic
    self-attribution. Type B species
    may show collective triadic
    structure (the school as a
    cognitive entity with its own
    triadic dynamics) rather than
    individual triadic structure.

Key predictions generated:
  - Type B species fail MSR even
    with priming (because selection
    has worked AGAINST individual
    self-model).
  - Type A species pass domain-
    appropriate tests systematically.
  - Wolf STSR performance should
    be higher when isolated than
    in pack context.
  - Octopus chromatophore-block
    test should show strong positive
    self-model response.
  - Ambush predatory fish show
    stronger lateral line efference
    copy (self-subtraction) than
    schooling prey fish.
  - Deep sea species show
    hydrodynamic self-recognition
    via lateral line anomaly response.
