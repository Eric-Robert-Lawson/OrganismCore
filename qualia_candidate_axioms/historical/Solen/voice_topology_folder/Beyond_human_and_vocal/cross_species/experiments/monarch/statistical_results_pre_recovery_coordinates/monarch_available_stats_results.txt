====================================================
TEST 1: RAYLEIGH TEST
FM False Attractor Bearing
Distribution — All Unique
Tagging Locations
====================================================

H0: FM false attractor bearings
    are uniformly distributed
    across all compass directions.

H1: FM false attractor bearings
    are non-uniformly distributed,
    indicating systematic bias in
    the FM infrastructure relative
    to the migration corridor.

N locations:          3,099
Mean resultant length R̄: 0.0494
Mean direction:       218.9°
Rayleigh z:           7.5642
p-value:              0.000517

Result: p < 0.001 — HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT

Mean FM false attractor bearing
across migration corridor:
  218.9° (SW)

Interpretation:
  Non-uniform distribution means
  the FM infrastructure is not
  randomly oriented relative to
  tagging locations — it shows
  systematic directional bias.

Supplementary: Rayleigh test on
FM opposition angle distribution
(opposition angles doubled to
 use full circular range):
  N: 3,099
  Mean opposition: 86.1°
  R̄ (doubled): 0.0540
  p-value: 0.000117

====================================================
TEST 2: WATSON-WILLIAMS TEST
Oklahoma vs Ontario
FM False Attractor Bearing
Distributions
====================================================

H0: Mean FM false attractor bearing
    is equal in Oklahoma and Ontario.

H1: Mean FM false attractor bearing
    differs between the highest-
    opposition state (OK, 142.6°)
    and lowest-opposition state
    (ON, 49.5°), establishing the
    dose contrast for the recovery
    analysis.

Oklahoma unique locations: 53
Ontario unique locations:  36

Oklahoma:
  Mean FM bearing: 106.8°
  R̄: 0.0826
  Rayleigh p: 0.698292

Ontario:
  Mean FM bearing: 152.7°
  R̄: 0.7315
  Rayleigh p: 0.000000

Watson-Williams test:
  F(1, 87) = 1.7389
  p-value: 0.190743

Result: p >= 0.05 — NOT SIGNIFICANT

Context:
  OK mean expected bearing: 189.3°
  OK mean FM bearing:       106.8°
  OK mean opposition:       82.4°

  ON mean expected bearing: 223.7°
  ON mean FM bearing:       152.7°
  ON mean opposition:       71.0°

Interpretation:
  A significant Watson-Williams
  result confirms that OK and ON
  monarchs face statistically
  distinct FM false attractor
  environments — establishing
  the dose contrast that will
  be used in the recovery
  bearing analysis.

====================================================
TEST 3: CIRCULAR-LINEAR
CORRELATION
FM Strength vs FM Opposition
Angle
====================================================

Question: do locations with
stronger FM false attractor
signals (higher strength) tend
to have higher opposition angles
— i.e., are the two risk factors
(strong signal AND wrong direction)
co-distributed geographically?

A positive correlation means
high-strength attractors tend to
point in more-opposed directions.
A near-zero correlation means the
two risk factors are independent.

N unique locations: 3,099

Linear (Pearson) correlation
  FM strength vs opposition angle:
  r = -0.0204
  p = 0.255602

Rank (Spearman) correlation
  FM strength vs opposition angle:
  rho = -0.0274
  p = 0.127759

Circular-linear correlation
  (Mardia 1976 method):
  r_cl = 0.0432
  F = 2.8986
  p = 0.055251

Result: No significant circular-
linear association detected.

FM strength quartile breakdown
(pre-registered boundaries):

Quartile        N   Mean_opp   Median_opp   Mean_str
----------------------------------------------------
Q1            870      88.8°        89.9°     0.0097
Q2            933      86.1°        82.3°     0.0154
Q3            555      83.0°        77.0°     0.0212
Q4            741      85.3°        80.5°     0.0312

Interpretation:
  If high-strength FM signals
  (Q4) show higher mean opposition
  than low-strength signals (Q1),
  the two risk factors co-vary —
  the most disruptive locations
  are also the most misdirecting.

====================================================
TEST 4: MONTE CARLO PERMUTATION
TEST
Geographic Clustering of
High-Risk Locations
====================================================

Question: is the geographic
concentration of high-risk
tagging locations (opposition
> 120°, strength > 0.01) more
clustered than expected by chance
given the distribution of all
tagging effort?

Method: permute FM false attractor
bearings and strengths across all
3,074 unique locations 10,000 times.
Each permutation computes the
high-risk location count within
each of 4 geographic quadrants.
Compare observed quadrant counts
to the permutation null distribution.

Observed high-risk locations: 809 / 3,099 (26.1%)

Observed high-risk count by
geographic quadrant:

  NW (MN/SD/WI):
    High-risk: 150 / 491 (30.5%)
  NE (MA/CT/NJ/NY):
    High-risk: 158 / 634 (24.9%)
  Central (OK/KS/TX):
    High-risk: 146 / 519 (28.1%)
  SE (SC/FL/GA):
    High-risk: 39 / 123 (31.7%)

Permutation test results:

Quadrant                      Observed  Perm_mean  Perm_SD   p-value
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NW (MN/SD/WI)                      150      127.3     8.98    0.0074 **
NE (MA/CT/NJ/NY)                   158      170.8    10.02    0.9052
Central (OK/KS/TX)                 146      135.3     9.19    0.1311
SE (SC/FL/GA)                       39       33.0     4.83    0.1271

* p<0.05  ** p<0.01  *** p<0.001

Interpretation:
  Significant quadrants show more
  high-risk locations than expected
  by chance given the tagging effort
  distribution. This means the FM
  infrastructure in those regions
  is genuinely more opposed to
  migration than a random FM
  landscape would be.

SUMMARY OF ALL FOUR TESTS
====================================================

Test                                     Result                  p

1. Rayleigh — FM bearing dist            SIGNIFICANT      0.000517
2. Watson-Williams — OK vs ON            NS               0.190743
3. Circ-lin corr — str vs opp            NS               0.055251
4. Permutation — cluster geo             SIGNIFICANT        0.0074

NOTE: All four tests are exploratory
and descriptive. None are the
primary pre-registered hypothesis
test. All run on tagging data only.
The primary V-test requires recovery
coordinates (Monarch Watch pending).
