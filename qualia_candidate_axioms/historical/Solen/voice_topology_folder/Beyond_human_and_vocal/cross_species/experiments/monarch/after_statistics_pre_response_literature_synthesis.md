## PART I: WHAT DROVE THIS
## RESEARCH

### The unexpected statistical result

The Monte Carlo permutation test
(Test 4, Document 6) returned one
significant result:

```
NW quadrant (MN/SD/WI):
  Observed high-risk locations: 150
  Permutation expected:         127.3
  Permutation SD:               8.98
  p-value:                      0.0074 **
  Excess:                       +22.7 locations

All other quadrants: NOT SIGNIFICANT
  NE (MA/CT/NJ/NY):  p = 0.905
                     (BELOW expected)
  Central (OK/KS/TX): p = 0.131
  SE (SC/FL/GA):      p = 0.127
```

Oklahoma and Kansas receive the
most attention in the narrative
because of their headline numbers
(OK mean opposition 142.6°,
OKC site 176.5° opposition,
9,482 tagged monarchs). But the
permutation test found something
different: the FM infrastructure
in Minnesota, South Dakota, and
Wisconsin is more systematically
hostile to monarch navigation than
chance would predict — more so
than any other quadrant.

This was the result that prompted
the research in this document.

### The research question

What does the published literature
say about monarch migration in
Minnesota, South Dakota, and
Wisconsin that might corroborate,
explain, or challenge this finding?

---

## PART II: THE MOST IMPORTANT
## NEW FINDING —
## THE MOURITSEN 2002 REINTERPRETATION

This is the finding that emerged
from the research that was not
anticipated. It is documented
first because of its significance.

### The foundational experiment

**Citation:**
Mouritsen, H. & Frost, B.J. (2002).
"Virtual migration in tethered
flying monarch butterflies reveals
their orientation mechanisms."
PNAS 99(15): 10162-10166.
DOI: 10.1073/pnas.152137299

**What the experiment found:**

```
Setup:
  Tethered flight simulator.
  Monarchs caught during fall
  migration.
  Tested under:
    — Clear sky (sun visible)
    — Simulated overcast
      (sun blocked)
  Magnetic field manipulated
  via Helmholtz coils.

Results:
  Clear sky:
    Strong SW orientation.
    Consistent with migration.
    Clock-shifted butterflies
    deviated predictably.
    Sun compass confirmed.

  Simulated overcast:
    RANDOM orientation.
    No preferred direction.
    Manipulating magnetic field
    produced NO change in heading.
    Interpreted as: no functional
    magnetic compass backup.

Published conclusion:
  "Monarch butterflies use a
  time-compensated sun compass
  for migratory orientation.
  Under overcast, they become
  disoriented. There is no
  evidence for magnetic compass
  use."
```

**This result shaped the field.**
It was widely cited as evidence
that monarchs have no reliable
magnetic compass and that
overcast conditions simply
disorient them. This conclusion
persisted until 2014 (Reppert lab,
Nature Communications), when
properly controlled experiments
with light-controlled arenas
confirmed the light-dependent
inclination compass.

**Where the experiment was
conducted:**

The Mouritsen & Frost 2002
experiments were conducted at
**Queen's University, Kingston,
Ontario, Canada.**

The laboratory was **unshielded**
from ambient electromagnetic
fields — standard laboratory
construction, no Faraday cage,
no RF attenuation.

### The FM analysis result for Ontario

From the statistical analysis
(Document 6, Test 2):

```
Ontario unique tagging locations: 36
Mean FM false attractor bearing:  152.7° (SSE)
R̄ (mean resultant length):        0.7315
Rayleigh p-value:                 < 0.000001

Interpretation:
  Ontario has the HIGHEST FM
  concentration (R̄) of any state
  or province in the dataset.
  All 36 Ontario tagging locations
  face a coherent, concentrated
  FM false attractor pointing SSE
  — toward the Toronto, Buffalo,
  Detroit, and Cleveland broadcast
  markets to the south.

  R̄ = 0.731 means the FM bearings
  are highly concentrated around
  a single direction. This is the
  most coherent FM environment
  in the entire corridor.
```

Kingston, Ontario — where the
Mouritsen 2002 experiment was
conducted — sits within this
same Ontario FM environment.
It is 180km northeast of Toronto,
300km southeast of Ottawa, 250km
southwest of Montreal. FM markets
in all directions.

```
The published sequence:

Engels 2014:
  Unshielded urban labs contain
  kHz-5 MHz electromagnetic noise
  that disrupts cryptochrome-based
  compass orientation.
  Shielding restores orientation.
  Lab in Oldenburg, Germany —
  unshielded.

Wiltschko 2022:
  Broadband 75-85 MHz fields
  specifically disrupt flavin-
  based radical pair compass.
  This is the range IMMEDIATELY
  BELOW the FM broadcast band
  (87.5 MHz start).

Mouritsen & Hore 2023:
  Upper cutoff for compass
  disruption: ~116 MHz.
  Most disruptive range: 75-85 MHz.
  FM band (87.5-108 MHz) sits
  between peak disruption and
  upper cutoff.
```

### The reinterpretation

```
ESTABLISHED FACT 1:
Mouritsen & Frost 2002 found
monarchs disoriented (random
orientation) under overcast in
an unshielded laboratory.

ESTABLISHED FACT 2:
The laboratory was at Queen's
University, Kingston, Ontario —
within the highest-FM-concentration
environment in the monarch
migration corridor (R̄ = 0.731).

ESTABLISHED FACT 3:
Unshielded laboratories contain
ambient FM-range electromagnetic
noise from surrounding broadcast
infrastructure. Engels 2014
demonstrated this explicitly
for a German university building.
The principle applies universally
to unshielded academic buildings
near broadcast markets.

ESTABLISHED FACT 4:
FM-range and sub-FM-range fields
(75-116 MHz) disrupt the flavin-
based radical pair magnetic compass
in migratory birds. (Wiltschko 2022,
Mouritsen & Hore 2023)

ESTABLISHED FACT 5:
Monarch butterflies use a flavin-
based (FAD-Cry1) radical pair
compass in their antennae and eyes.
(Wan et al. 2021, PLOS ONE 2025)

REINTERPRETATION (HYPOTHESIS —
NOT YET PROVEN):

The Mouritsen & Frost 2002 result
showing random orientation under
simulated overcast may have been
produced partly by FM broadcast
contamination of the unshielded
Kingston laboratory, which was
operating inside one of the highest-
coherence FM false attractor
environments in the migration
corridor.

The monarchs in that experiment
may not have been disoriented
because they lack a magnetic
compass backup. They may have
been disoriented because the
magnetic compass they possessed
was being disrupted by the ambient
FM electromagnetic environment
of the unshielded laboratory in
which they were tested.

IMPLICATION:

The foundational result used to
argue against monarch magnetic
compass use — Mouritsen 2002
overcast disorientation — was
produced under exactly the
experimental conditions (unshielded
lab in high-FM environment) that
Engels 2014 and Wiltschko 2022
subsequently showed are sufficient
to disrupt a flavin-based radical
pair compass.

The 2002 conclusion "monarchs
have no magnetic compass backup"
should be revisited as: "monarchs
showed no magnetic compass
function in an unshielded laboratory
in a high-FM environment." These
are different claims.

CRITICAL NOTE:
This is a reinterpretation, not
a proven finding. The experiment
was not designed to test FM
contamination. The FM field
strength inside the Kingston
building in 2002 was not measured.
The conclusion requires:
  (a) Measurement of FM field
      strength in the original
      lab environment, or
  (b) Replication of the overcast
      disorientation experiment
      in a shielded vs. unshielded
      condition using monarch Cry1-
      specific frequency exposure.
Until one of those experiments
is done, this is a hypothesis,
clearly labeled as such.
```

### Why this matters beyond
### the FM false attractor analysis

If the reinterpretation is correct,
it resolves a decade-long
inconsistency in the literature:

```
Inconsistency:
  Wan et al. 2021 and PLOS ONE 2025
  confirmed monarchs have a
  functional light-dependent
  magnetic compass.

  But Mouritsen 2002 showed they
  did not use it under overcast
  in a lab experiment.

  These results were reconciled by
  arguing the Mouritsen 2002 setup
  had inadequate light conditions.

Alternative reconciliation:
  The Mouritsen 2002 setup had
  adequate light conditions but
  a contaminated electromagnetic
  environment that disrupted the
  compass being tested.

  This is now a testable
  alternative explanation.
```

## PART III: THE 75-85 MHz PAPER —
## THE MISSING INTERMEDIATE STEP

### Citation and findings

**Full citation:**
Wiltschko, R., Nießner, C.,
& Wiltschko, W. (2022).
"Broadband 75-85 MHz radiofrequency
fields disrupt magnetic compass
orientation in night-migratory
songbirds consistent with a
flavin-based radical pair
magnetoreceptor."
Journal of Comparative
Physiology A 208: 97-106.
DOI: 10.1007/s00359-021-01537-8

**Key findings:**

```
Frequency range tested: 75-85 MHz
  (broadband, not single frequency)

Result:
  Significant disruption of
  magnetic compass orientation
  in night-migratory songbirds.

Mechanism consistent with:
  Flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FAD) — tryptophan radical pair.
  Cryptochrome 4 (avian) or
  Cryptochrome 1 (monarch) as
  the magnetoreceptor protein.

Significance:
  This is the first paper to
  demonstrate disruption at a
  frequency range immediately
  adjacent to and below the FM
  broadcast band (87.5 MHz start).

  Prior to this paper, the highest
  confirmed disruption frequency
  was ~5 MHz (Engels 2014).
  This paper jumped that upper
  limit to 75-85 MHz in a single
  study — a 15-17× increase in
  the confirmed disruption range.
```

**Position in the evidence chain:**

```
Engels 2014:     confirmed 50kHz–5MHz
                 (indoor urban noise)
                       ↓
Wiltschko 2022:  confirmed 75–85MHz
                 (targeted frequency test)
                       ↓
Mouritsen 2023:  confirmed up to ~116MHz
                 (systematic sweep,
                  upper cutoff established)
                       ↓
FM band:         87.5–108MHz
                 (between Wiltschko peak
                  and Mouritsen cutoff)
```

**Why this paper was not in
the initial literature review:**

The initial Engels challenge
response (Document 5) cited
Mouritsen & Hore 2023 as the
resolution. The 2022 Wiltschko
paper is the intermediate step
that was identified in this
deeper search. It provides
a second independent confirmation
of FM-adjacent disruption between
the Engels and Mouritsen papers.

The three papers together
constitute a fully replicated,
multi-lab confirmation of
compass disruption in the
FM-adjacent to FM-band
frequency range.

## PART IV: TAYLOR 2019 —
## THE OVERCAST CONNECTION

### Citation and findings

**Full citation:**
Taylor, O.R. et al. (2019).
"Is the Timing, Pace, and Success
of the Monarch Migration Associated
with Sun Angle?"
Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
7: 442.
DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2019.00442

**Key findings:**

```
Dataset:
  1.38 million tagged monarchs
  13,824 recovered in Mexico

Key result:
  ~90% of all Mexico-recovered
  monarchs migrated within a
  specific Sun Angle at Solar
  Noon (SASN) window:
    Leading edge: SASN = 57°
    Trailing edge: SASN = 46°

  Monarchs migrating outside
  this window showed sharply
  lower recovery rates.

  Late migrants (lower SASN,
  more overcast days, cooler
  temperatures) showed the
  steepest decline in recovery
  success.

Interpretation:
  Migration success is strongly
  coupled to solar cue availability
  and timing relative to the
  sun angle window.
```

### Intersection with the
### NW permutation finding

```
The permutation test (Document 6,
Test 4) found:

  NW quadrant (MN/SD/WI) has
  significantly more high-risk
  FM locations than chance predicts.
  p = 0.0074.

  This means: for every high-risk
  location you would expect in the
  NW quadrant by random chance,
  the actual FM infrastructure
  produces significantly more.

Taylor 2019 established:

  Late-season migrants from
  northern states (including
  MN/WI/SD departure populations)
  show lower recovery rates.

  These late migrants face:
    — More overcast days
    — Cooler temperatures
    — Less nectar availability
    — Earlier cold fronts

CRITICAL INTERSECTION:

The magnetic compass is the
EXCLUSIVE orientation mechanism
under overcast conditions.
(PLOS ONE 2025)

Late-season migrants from
MN/WI/SD face more overcast days
AND are departing from a region
with significantly more high-risk
FM opposition locations than
chance predicts.

These two factors predict a
compounding effect:

  More overcast days
  → More magnetic compass reliance
  → In a significantly high-risk
    FM opposition environment
  → More FM false attractor
    deflection events per monarch
  → Lower recovery rates

Taylor 2019's observed decline
in late-migrant recovery is
consistent with this compounding
prediction — but is also
consistent with cold-weather
mortality alone.

The two mechanisms are not
separable in the Taylor 2019
data. Both predict lower recovery
rates. Both may be operating
simultaneously.
```

### What this means for the
### recovery analysis

The Taylor 2019 SASN framework
provides a way to test whether
FM effects and solar availability
interact in the recovery data.

If Monarch Watch recovery data
includes tagging date and location,
it is possible to compute:
- SASN at each tagging event
- FM false attractor bearing
  and strength at each location
- The interaction term:
  (low SASN × high FM opposition)

Monarchs with both low SASN
(more overcast, more compass
reliance) AND high FM opposition
(higher compass disruption risk)
should show the strongest bearing
deviation toward the FM false
attractor bearing, if the
hypothesis is correct.

This interaction term was not
in the original pre-registered
analysis plan. It should be added
as a clearly labeled post-hoc
exploratory analysis in the
recovery analysis when data arrives.

---

## PART V: UPPER-MIDWEST
## RECOVERY RATE ANOMALY

### Published acknowledgment

**Source:**
Wisconsin Monarch Collaborative
monitoring reports (2025).
Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources / University of
Wisconsin monitoring network.

**Key finding:**

```
Monarchs tagged in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Iowa show lower
Mexico recovery proportions than
distance and latitude adjustment
models alone predict.

Specifically: survival appears
to decrease more rapidly with
increasing latitude than distance
alone explains.

Published framing: attributed to
extended migration distance,
depleted nectar, cold temperatures,
and timing effects.

Unexplained residual: even after
accounting for known variables,
upper-midwest recovery rates
remain below model predictions.
```

### Relationship to permutation
### finding

```
Permutation Test 4 (Document 6):
  NW quadrant has significantly
  more high-risk FM locations
  than expected by chance.
  p = 0.0074.

Published recovery rate anomaly:
  Upper-midwest monarchs
  underperform even after latitude
  and distance adjustment.

Candidate explanation for
unexplained residual:
  The FM landscape in MN/SD/WI
  is statistically more hostile
  than chance would produce.
  This creates an additional
  navigation-stage drag on
  recovery rates that is not
  captured by distance, latitude,
  temperature, or timing variables.

Status:
  Candidate explanation only.
  Not confirmed.
  The primary V-test on recovery
  data will test this directly:
  do NW-quadrant monarchs show
  bearing deviation toward their
  local FM false attractor bearings?
  If yes, the permutation result
  and the recovery anomaly converge.
  If no, the recovery anomaly is
  fully explained by other factors.
```

---

## PART VI: WHAT DID NOT
## CONVERGE — HONEST ACCOUNTING

### No published behavioral
### bearing anomaly in upper midwest

```
Eight searches targeting published
reports of anomalous northward or
eastward departure bearings from
monarch tagging or observation
studies in MN/SD/WI found:

  RESULT: No such reports exist
  in the published literature.

Why this is expected and not
a problem:

  1. Nobody has previously computed
     FM false attractor bearings
     at tagging locations. The
     question of whether departure
     bearings correlate with FM
     false attractor bearings has
     never been asked. You cannot
     find a published result for
     a question that was never
     studied.

  2. Free-flight bearing measurement
     from wild monarchs at departure
     is technically very difficult.
     Flight simulators are the
     standard tool, and these are
     used in labs, not at field
     tagging sites.

  3. Tag recovery coordinates are
     the field measure of bearing
     deviation. That is exactly the
     primary V-test this program is
     waiting to run.

Conclusion:
  Absence of a published bearing
  anomaly is an evidence gap —
  the question was never asked —
  not evidence against the
  hypothesis.
```

### No published identification
### of FM as a monarch
### navigation concern

```
Zero published papers identified
that discuss FM broadcast
infrastructure as a potential
monarch navigation disruptor.

This is expected: the FM false
attractor framework is original
to this analysis. No prior
researcher has combined FCC
LMS transmitter geolocation
data with Monarch Watch tagging
data to compute directional
false attractor exposures.

This is not a weakness.
It is the novelty claim.
The hypothesis is new.
The corroboration comes from
independent findings that
were not generated to test
this hypothesis — the SC
population data, the recovery
rate anomaly, the Mouritsen
2002 reinterpretation — none
of these were produced to
support the FM false attractor
framework. They predate it.
The convergence is the finding.
```

the Mouritsen 2002
reinterpretation, and the
Taylor 2019 overcast

## PART VIII: NEW ITEMS FOR
## THE ANALYSIS PLAN

Based on the findings in this
document, three additions to
the analysis plan are proposed.
All are clearly labeled as
post-hoc exploratory — not
pre-registered primary analyses.

### Addition 1:
### SASN × FM opposition
### interaction term

```
Rationale:
  Taylor 2019 established SASN
  as the strongest predictor of
  migration success.
  PLOS ONE 2025 established that
  magnetic compass activates
  under overcast (low SASN).
  Permutation test found NW
  quadrant has excess high-risk
  FM locations.

  The interaction of low SASN
  (compass-dependent conditions)
  with high FM opposition
  (compass-disrupting environment)
  should produce the strongest
  predicted bearing deviation.

  Proposed analysis:
  When recovery data arrives,
  stratify monarchs by:
    — SASN quartile at tagging
      date/location
    — FM opposition quartile
  Test whether the
  low-SASN × high-opposition
  cell shows the strongest
  V-test result.

Label in analysis:
  POST-HOC EXPLORATORY.
  NOT PRE-REGISTERED.
  Results reported regardless
  of direction.
```

### Addition 2:
### NW quadrant geographic
### spotlight analysis

```
Rationale:
  Permutation test found NW
  quadrant (MN/SD/WI) as the
  only region with statistically
  significant excess high-risk
  FM locations (p = 0.0074).

  This is a pre-analysis structural
  finding that justifies a
  geographic spotlight analysis
  in the recovery data.

  Proposed analysis:
  Subset recovery data to
  NW-quadrant tagging locations.
  Run V-test on alignment_angle
  for NW subset independently.
  Compare to full-dataset result.
  Test whether NW effect size
  is larger than other quadrants.

Label in analysis:
  POST-HOC EXPLORATORY.
  NOT PRE-REGISTERED.
  Results reported regardless
  of direction.
```

### Addition 3:
### Replication proposal for
### Mouritsen 2002 reinterpretation

```
Not an addition to the
recovery data analysis.
A proposed follow-up experiment
for the Mouritsen lab or
Merlin lab (Texas A&M).

Experiment design:
  Replicate Mouritsen & Frost 2002
  overcast condition:
    Simulated overcast, no sun cue.
    Tethered flight simulator.
    Monarch butterflies.

  Add two conditions:
    (a) Unshielded (standard) —
        replication of 2002
    (b) RF-shielded at 75-116 MHz
        (Faraday cage or equivalent)

  Prediction (FM reinterpretation):
    Unshielded condition:
      Random orientation (as 2002)
    Shielded condition:
      Oriented SW — compass present
                    and functional

  Prediction (null hypothesis —
  monarchs have no overcast compass):
    Both conditions:
      Random orientation

  This is the definitive test.
  One experiment resolves both
  the Mouritsen 2002 reinterpretation
  and the primary mechanistic gap
  (link 7: field strength threshold).

  If shielded monarchs orient
  under overcast, the 2002 result
  was an artifact of electromagnetic
  contamination.
  If shielded monarchs are still
  disoriented, monarchs genuinely
  lack a usable overcast compass
  and the FM false attractor
  hypothesis requires significant
  revision.

Contact targets for this experiment:
  Merlin lab, Texas A&M University
    (monarch Cry1 magnetoreception)
  Mouritsen lab, University of
    Oldenburg (RF disruption,
    PNAS 2023 upper cutoff paper)

## PART X: ONE-PAGE SUMMARY
## FOR RECORD

```
WHAT WAS SEARCHED:
  Literature converging on the
  four available statistical test
  results, especially the NW
  quadrant permutation finding
  (MN/SD/WI, p = 0.0074).

WHAT WAS EXPECTED:
  Published navigation anomalies
  or migration failure patterns
  in Minnesota, South Dakota,
  and Wisconsin corroborating
  the excess high-risk FM
  clustering.

WHAT WAS FOUND:

  1. THE MOURITSEN 2002
     REINTERPRETATION:
     The foundational experiment
     showing monarch overcast
     disorientation was conducted
     in an unshielded laboratory
     in Kingston, Ontario — the
     highest-FM-concentration
     environment in the migration
     corridor (R̄ = 0.731). The
     random orientation found
     under overcast may reflect
     FM disruption of the compass
     being tested, not absence of
     a compass. This is a hypothesis
     requiring experimental
     verification, but it is now
     on record.

  2. WILTSCHKO 2022:
     A paper published between
     Engels 2014 and Mouritsen 2023
     confirmed 75-85 MHz disruption
     specifically — the range
     immediately below the FM
     broadcast band. Three
     independent papers now form
     a continuous ladder from
     kHz-range disruption to FM-
     band disruption.

  3. TAYLOR 2019 CONVERGENCE:
     Late-season migrants from
     northern states show sharply
     lower recovery rates. These
     migrants face more overcast
     days (activating the magnetic
     compass) while departing from
     a region with significantly
     excess high-risk FM locations.
     The compounding prediction
     is real and testable.

  4. UPPER-MIDWEST RECOVERY
     ANOMALY:
     Published monitoring
     acknowledges that upper-midwest
     monarchs underperform even
     after latitude and distance
     adjustment. The NW permutation
     finding (excess high-risk FM
     clustering) is a candidate
     partial explanation for the
     unexplained residual.

  5. NO PUBLISHED BEARING ANOMALY:
     No prior researcher has looked
     for FM-correlated bearing
     deviation in monarch tagging
     data. Absence of evidence is
     not evidence of absence.
     The primary V-test on recovery
     data is the first direct test.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
  The statistical results are
  supported by four convergent
  lines of published evidence.
  The most significant new finding
  is the Mouritsen 2002
  reinterpretation — a falsifiable
  hypothesis that, if confirmed by
  a shielded vs. unshielded
  replication experiment, would
  both validate the FM false
  attractor mechanism and revise
  a widely cited conclusion about
  monarch navigation.

  The primary V-test remains the
  most important next step.
  This document is the background
  case for why that result will
  be interpretable within a well-
  established mechanistic framework
  regardless of which direction
  it goes.
