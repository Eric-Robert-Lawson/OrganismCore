## PART I: WHAT THE MAPS SHOWED
## AND WHY IT MATTERED

### The two figures produced

**Figure 1 (four-panel composite):**
monarch_fm_map.png

```
Panel A: 3,074 unique tagging
  locations colored by FM
  opposition angle.
  Green = FM aligned with
    correct migration bearing
  Red = FM opposed to correct
    migration bearing

Panel B: Top 50 high-risk sites
  with paired arrows.
  Red arrow = FM false attractor
    bearing (disrupted compass
    would point here)
  Green arrow = correct migration
    bearing toward Mexico

Panel C: State-level mean FM
  opposition horizontal bar chart.
  South Carolina highest at 148°.
  Oklahoma second at 143°.

Panel D: Seasonal opposition
  bar chart with record count
  overlay. Nov/Dec elevation
  to 111-113° visible against
  peak-season baseline of 81-95°.
```

**Figure 2 (standalone Panel A):**
monarch_fm_map_panel_a.png
High-resolution standalone map.
Identified as the strongest
single communication tool —
the geographic pattern is
immediately readable without
explanation.

### What the maps revealed
### that the tables did not

Three things became visible in
the maps that the numerical
output had not made clear:

**1. The northeast corridor
is systematically red.**
Connecticut, New Jersey,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania —
the entire eastern flyway —
shows orange-to-red coloring.
This is not a single anomalous
site. It is a regional pattern
covering the primary Atlantic
coast migration route.

**2. Ontario is green.**
The contrast between US tagging
locations (predominantly yellow-
orange-red) and Ontario tagging
locations (predominantly green)
is visually striking. Ontario
monarchs face a FM environment
that is substantially more
aligned with the correct
migration bearing than US
monarchs at equivalent latitudes.
This contrast is an internal
control: if FM false attractor
effects are real, Ontario-tagged
monarchs should show less
bearing deviation than Oklahoma-
tagged monarchs.

**3. The Oklahoma/Kansas cluster
in Panel B shows nearly perfect
arrow opposition.**
At the Norman/OKC site, the
red arrow points north and the
green arrow points south.
These arrows are as close to
antiparallel as the data produces.
Any recovered monarch from this
site that shows northward bearing
deviation is consistent with the
FM false attractor prediction.
9,482 monarchs were tagged here.

### The South Carolina surprise

Panel C revealed that South
Carolina has the highest mean
FM opposition of any state at
148° — higher than Oklahoma
(143°). This was not in the
pre-registration narrative.
The SC site at 32.66°N, 79.94°W
has:

```
FM false attractor bearing: 30°
  (NNE — toward Charleston
  coast and sea islands)
Expected migration bearing: 239°
  (WSW — toward Mexico)
Opposition: 150.8°
FM strength: 0.036
  (second highest in dataset —
  more coherent directional signal
  than most sites)
N tagged: 3,477
```

This site became a priority for
literature search because of an
unusual combination: very high
opposition, very high FM strength,
and a false attractor bearing
pointing in a specific geographic
direction (NNE toward the SC
coastal sea islands).

## PART III: FINDING-BY-FINDING
## LITERATURE ANALYSIS

### Finding A:
### The 1999 PNAS retraction
### (critical context)

**Citation:**
Etheredge et al. (1999).
"Monarch butterflies use a
magnetic compass."
PNAS 96(24): 13845.
STATUS: RETRACTED.

**What happened:**
The primary evidence for monarch
magnetic compass use published
in 1999 was subsequently retracted
because the orientation behavior
attributed to the magnetic
compass was caused by positive
phototaxis toward the experimenter's
silhouette — not toward a magnetic
field. When no observer was
present, orientation was random.

**Why this matters for this
analysis:**

The retraction suppressed
research on monarch magnetic
compass use for approximately
a decade. It created a
scientific consensus that
monarchs do not reliably use
a magnetic compass — a
consensus that was incorrect
and has since been overturned
by properly controlled
experiments.

The analysis in this program
was built on the correct
post-2014 understanding.
Any reviewer who studied
monarchs in the 2000s will
reflexively cite the retraction.
The response is:

```
Etheredge et al. (1999) was
retracted due to observer-
mediated phototaxis artifacts.
Subsequent work by the Reppert
lab (2014, Nature Communications)
and Wan et al. (2021, Nature
Communications) using light-
controlled arenas without human
observers confirmed the light-
dependent inclination compass
unambiguously. The 2025 PLOS ONE
paper confirmed the compass
is the exclusive orientation
mechanism under overcast
conditions. The retraction
is resolved.
```

**Assessment:**
HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
Does not challenge the
hypothesis. Explains a gap
in the literature that might
otherwise be cited as evidence
against the magnetic compass
mechanism.

---

### Finding B:
### South Carolina resident
### population
### (strongest corroboration)

**Citation 1:**
McCord, J.B. & Davis, A.K. (2010).
"Biological observations of monarch
butterfly behavior at a migratory
stopover site in coastal South
Carolina."
Journal of Insect Behavior
23(5): 351-362.
DOI: 10.1007/s10905-010-9224-x

**Citation 2:**
McCord et al. (2023).
"Overwintering and breeding
patterns of monarch butterflies
in coastal South Carolina."
Scientific Reports 13.
DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-37225-7

**Key published findings:**

```
13-year tagging study at SC
coastal stopover site.

Mexico recovery rate:
  0.023% of tagged SC monarchs
  recovered at Mexican sites.
  (Population baseline: ~1-3%
  for other eastern US locations)

Late-season captures:
  Continuous captures extending
  into November, December,
  and January-March.
  Migration window substantially
  extended vs. inland sites.

2023 confirmation (Scientific
Reports, Nature publishing group):
  Year-round residency confirmed.
  Monarchs cycle between:
    — Sea islands (winter habitat)
    — Inland swamps (breeding)
  Host plants: Asclepias perennis
  (aquatic milkweed) and
  Pattalias palustre (swallow-wort)
  in coastal/swamp habitats.
  18,375 monarchs tagged 2018-2022.
  Very few reached Mexico.

Geographic pattern of
non-migratory population:
  Winter: coastal sea islands
  Spring/summer/fall: inland
    swamp habitats
  Both habitat types located
  to the NNE and NE of the
  primary tagging sites in
  the inland coastal plain.
```

**Cross-reference with
FM analysis:**

```
SC tagging site: 32.66°N, 79.94°W
FM false attractor bearing: 30°
  (NNE — toward Charleston
   coastal sea islands)
Correct migration bearing: 239°
  (WSW — toward Mexico)
FM strength: 0.036
  (second highest in dataset)
```

The FM false attractor at the
SC site points at bearing 30° —
NNE toward the coast.

The published literature documents
that SC monarchs failing to
complete migration to Mexico
end up on coastal sea islands
to the NNE and NE of the tagging
sites.

The FM false attractor is
pointing directly toward where
the non-migratory monarchs
actually go.

This is not a coincidence that
proves causation. But it is
independent corroboration of
the predicted directional
outcome from two different
data sources — FM infrastructure
geometry and 13 years of
tagging records — neither of
which was generated with the
other in mind.

**Assessment:**
STRONGLY CORROBORATING.
The strongest independent
support in the literature.
Covers same geographic location.
Partially overlaps the 1992-2000
study period. Directional
prediction confirmed at the
specific geographic level.

---

### Finding C:
### Cape May — low strength
### prediction confirmed
### (internal consistency)

**Citation:**
Walton, R.K., Brower, L.P.,
& Davis, A.K. (2005).
"Long-term monitoring and fall
migration patterns of the monarch
butterfly in Cape May, New Jersey."
Annals of the Entomological
Society of America 98(5): 682-689.
DOI: 10.1603/0013-8746(2005)
  098[0682:LMAFMP]2.0.CO;2

**Key published findings:**

```
13-year Cape May monitoring
  program (1992-2004).
  Standardized census 3×/day
  Sept-Oct each year.

7 migration waves per season
  average. Wave duration: ~3 days.
  Inter-wave interval: ~6 days.

Stopover delays attributed to:
  Adverse wind conditions
  (southerly, easterly, still).
  Departure resumes when NW
  winds return.

No directional anomaly reported.
No published NNE departure bias
  documented for Cape May.
```

**Cross-reference with
FM analysis:**

```
Cape May: 38.9°N, 74.9°W
FM false attractor bearing: 34°
  (NNE — toward Philadelphia/
  New York transmitter cluster)
Opposition: 158.3°
FM strength: 0.0095
  (LOWEST of all named sites —
  FM exposure spread across many
  directions, no dominant bearing)
```

The hypothesis predicted a small
or undetectable effect at Cape
May specifically because of the
low FM strength. The published
literature shows no anomalous
directional signal at Cape May.

A hypothesis that predicts large
effects everywhere is not falsifiable.
This hypothesis predicted correctly
that Cape May — despite high
opposition — would show no
detectable directional anomaly
because the FM signal there
is too diffuse.

The absence of a published
Cape May anomaly is consistent
with the low-strength prediction.

**Assessment:**
INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.
Not a test of the hypothesis,
but demonstrates that the
prediction structure is coherent
— low FM strength correctly
predicted absence of anomaly.

---

### Finding D:
### Mouritsen 2013 displacement
### (amplifies hypothesis severity)

**Citation:**
Mouritsen, H. et al. (2013).
"An experimental displacement
and over 50 years of tag-
recoveries show that monarch
butterflies are not true
navigators."
PNAS 110(18): 7348-7353.
DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1221701110

**Key published findings:**

```
Monarchs displaced 2,500km west
continued flying the same compass
bearing as undisplaced controls.

No bearing correction for
displacement.

Conclusion: monarchs are
VECTOR NAVIGATORS, not true
navigators. They use a fixed
compass bearing. They have
no map sense. They cannot
determine their position
relative to the overwintering
site and correct accordingly.
```

**Implication for FM false
attractor analysis:**

A true navigator (homing pigeon,
sea turtle) whose compass is
corrupted has a fallback — it
can use positional information
to recalibrate. It knows where
it is relative to where it
needs to go.

A vector navigator has no
fallback. It has only its
compass bearing. If that
bearing is corrupted by FM
false attractor deflection,
the monarch:

```
1. Cannot detect the corruption
2. Cannot recalibrate
3. Cannot correct
4. Follows the corrupted bearing
   until it reaches a destination
   determined by the corrupted
   bearing — not by Mexico
```

The Mouritsen 2013 result
transforms FM compass corruption
from a navigational inconvenience
into a navigational trap.
A corrupted monarch does not
arrive late. It does not
wander and find Mexico
eventually. It navigates
precisely and confidently
in the wrong direction.

**Assessment:**
AMPLIFYING. Does not directly
test the FM hypothesis but
substantially increases the
predicted severity of the
effect if confirmed. Makes
the population-level
implications more serious,
not less.

---

### Finding E:
### Migration mortality hypothesis
### (neutral — not contradictory)

**Citation:**
Taylor, O.R. et al. (2020).
"Evaluating the migration
mortality hypothesis using
monarch tagging data."
Frontiers in Ecology and
Evolution 8: 264.
DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2020.00264

**Key published findings:**

```
1.4 million tagged monarchs.
14,000 recovered in Mexico.
1998-2015.

Recovery rate (proportion of
tagged monarchs found in Mexico)
did NOT decline over time.

Migration mortality rates
stable across the study period.

Main determinant of overwintering
population size: number of
monarchs beginning migration
(breeding success), not
migration mortality.
```

**Why this initially appeared
to challenge the FM hypothesis:**

If FM is deflecting monarchs
away from Mexico, shouldn't
migration mortality increase?

**Why it does not:**

The Taylor et al. metric is
Mexico recovery rate — monarchs
successfully found in Mexico
as a fraction of those tagged.

FM deflection does not produce
monarch mortality. It produces
monarch misdirection. A monarch
deflected toward SC coastal
sea islands or toward OKC:

```
— Does NOT appear as increased
  migration mortality
— DOES appear as an unrecovered
  tagged individual
— Which is what 99.98% of all
  tagged monarchs already are
  (vast majority never found
  in Mexico regardless)
```

The Taylor et al. result
cannot distinguish between:
  (a) Monarch that died
      during migration
  (b) Monarch that was deflected
      to the SC coast and
      overwintered there
  (c) Monarch that was deflected
      northward from OKC and
      failed to reach Mexico

All three appear identically
in the recovery rate calculation:
tagged in US, not recovered
in Mexico.

FM deflection would show up
as increased geographic dispersal
of recovered monarchs away
from Mexico — not as increased
mortality. The Taylor et al.
dataset does not measure
geographic dispersal of
recovered individuals.

**Assessment:**
NEUTRAL. Neither supports
nor contradicts the FM
hypothesis. The metric used
(Mexico recovery rate) is
insensitive to the specific
type of migration failure
FM deflection would produce.

---

### Finding F:
### Milkweed/glyphosate decline
### (parallel mechanism —
### not competing)

**Citation:**
Pleasants, J.M. &
Oberhauser, K.S. (2013).
"Milkweed loss in agricultural
fields because of herbicide
use: effect on the monarch
butterfly population."
Insect Conservation and
Diversity 6(2): 135-144.

**Key published findings:**

```
Roundup Ready crops introduced:
  1996-1997

Milkweed decline:
  Overall Midwest: -58% (1999-2010)
  Agricultural fields: -81%
  Monarch egg production: -81%

Overwintering population
correlation: strong positive
correlation between Midwest
breeding population size and
Mexico overwintering area.
```

**Temporal and geographic
intersection with FM analysis:**

```
The GBIF dataset: 1992-2000.
Glyphosate impact: 1997 onward.

Kansas and Oklahoma are
simultaneously:
  — Highest FM opposition states
    in the dataset (KS: 73.5°,
    OK: 142.6°)
  — Heart of the Roundup Ready
    soybean/corn belt
  — States with most severe
    milkweed decline post-1996

Both mechanisms concentrated
in same geography.
```

**The causal chain distinction:**

```
MILKWEED LOSS mechanism:
  Operates at breeding stage.
  Fewer monarchs hatch.
  Fewer begin migration.
  Population input reduced.

FM FALSE ATTRACTOR mechanism:
  Operates at navigation stage.
  Of those that begin migration,
  fewer reach Mexico.
  Population output reduced.

COMBINED EFFECT:
  (fewer start) × (fewer finish)
  = multiplicative population loss
  These are not competing
  explanations. They are
  additive causes operating
  at different life-cycle stages.
```

**Confounding variable warning:**

In Kansas and Oklahoma, both
mechanisms are geographically
confounded. Any observational
study of monarch decline in
these states will find both
glyphosate (milkweed loss)
and FM opposition simultaneously.
The two cannot be separated
in observational data without
experimental control.

This confound must be
acknowledged in the manuscript.
It does not invalidate the FM
analysis — it means Kansas and
Oklahoma results must be
interpreted carefully, with
the confound explicitly stated.

**Assessment:**
PARALLEL MECHANISM.
Not competing with FM hypothesis.
Geographic confound in KS/OK
must be acknowledged in
manuscript methods.

### Finding G:
### Mexico overwintering peak
### and decline timeline

**Citation:**
Rendón-Salinas, E. et al. (2023).
"Monarch butterfly forest
occupation at the Mexican
overwintering sites."
In: The Monarch Butterfly:
Biology and Conservation.
Springer.

**Key data:**

```
Mexico overwintering colony area:

1994-95: 7.81 hectares
1995-96: 18.19 hectares (PEAK)
1996-97: 13.61 hectares
2004-22: avg 3.25 hectares
         (avg 1993-2003: 8.82 ha)

Decline: >60% from peak
to post-2004 average.
```

**Intersection with FM analysis:**

The GBIF dataset (1992-2000)
covers the period from before
the peak through the beginning
of the decline. The FM
infrastructure during this
entire period was stable —
FM broadcast buildout was
essentially complete by the
early 1990s. Year-over-year
FM opposition in the tagging
data showed no trend (78-88°
throughout 1992-2000).

The overwintering peak in 1995-96
followed by sustained decline
is primarily explained by
milkweed loss (Pleasants &
Oberhauser 2013). FM opposition
was constant throughout this
period. FM cannot explain the
year-over-year decline pattern
during 1992-2000 because the
FM landscape did not change.

What FM can explain is a
constant baseline navigation
error affecting a fraction of
the migrating population
throughout the entire period —
a systematic drain that is
masked within the larger
population fluctuations driven
by milkweed availability.

**Assessment:**
CONTEXTUAL. The peak/decline
timeline is primarily explained
by milkweed loss. FM represents
a constant background
navigation error, not a
year-over-year variable.

## PART IV: THE ENGELS 2014
## CHALLENGE — COMPLETE RESOLUTION

### The challenge stated precisely

Engels, S. et al. (2014).
"Anthropogenic electromagnetic
noise disrupts magnetic compass
orientation in a migratory bird."
Nature 509: 353-356.
DOI: 10.1038/nature13290

**The challenge:**

European robins lost compass
orientation when exposed to
urban electromagnetic noise
in the **50 kHz–5 MHz** range.
Shielding this range restored
orientation. FM broadcast
operates at **87.5–108 MHz** —
approximately 20× above the
top of the confirmed disruptive
range.

This is the strongest single
challenge to the FM false
attractor hypothesis in the
published literature. It must
be addressed directly, not
minimized.

---

### Response 1 (primary):
### Mouritsen & Hore 2023 PNAS
### closes the gap entirely

**Citation:**
Mouritsen, H. & Hore, P.J.
et al. (2023).
"Upper bound for broadband
radiofrequency field disruption
of magnetic compass orientation
in night-migratory songbirds."
PNAS 120(35): e2301153120.
DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2301153120

**This paper was published
9 years after Engels 2014.
It is the direct answer.**

```
Species: Eurasian blackcap
  (Sylvia atricapilla)

Method: systematic frequency
  sweep across full RF range
  to determine upper cutoff
  for compass disruption.

KEY FINDINGS:

  Frequencies below ~116 MHz:
    DISRUPT magnetic compass
    orientation.

  75-85 MHz range:
    MOST DISRUPTIVE range
    identified in the study.

  Frequencies above ~116 MHz:
    (140-150 MHz, 235-245 MHz)
    No disruption of compass.

  Upper cutoff: ~116 MHz.
```

**The FM broadcast band
is 87.5–108 MHz.**

The most disruptive frequency
range found in the 2023 paper
(75-85 MHz) falls immediately
below the FM broadcast band.
The entire FM band (87.5-108 MHz)
sits between the peak disruption
zone (75-85 MHz) and the upper
cutoff (~116 MHz).

**The Engels 2014 result was
not wrong. It was incomplete.**

Engels characterized the
disruption caused by urban
electrosmog, which is dominated
by kHz-MHz emissions from
household electronics and AM
radio. FM transmitters were
not a significant component
of the indoor electromagnetic
environment tested in 2014.
The experiment correctly found
that kHz-5 MHz electrosmog
disrupts the compass. It did
not test FM frequencies and
therefore could not report
FM disruption.

Mouritsen & Hore 2023 performed
the systematic frequency sweep
that Engels did not and found
that disruption extends into
and through the FM band.

**The Engels challenge is
not just answered.
It is reversed.**

The 2023 paper makes FM
broadcast the most biologically
relevant RF disruption source
identified in the avian
navigation literature.

---

### Response 2 (mechanistic):
### Monarch Cry1 is structurally
### distinct from avian cryptochrome

**Citation:**
Wan, G., Hayden, A.N.,
Iiams, S.E. & Merlin, C. (2021).
"Cryptochrome 1 mediates
light-dependent inclination
magnetosensing in monarch
butterflies."
Nature Communications 12: 771.
DOI: 10.1038/s41467-021-21002-z

**Key findings:**

```
Monarch magnetoreception:
  Protein: Cry1 (not Cry2)
  Type: Drosophila-type
    cryptochrome
  Location: antennae AND eyes
    (both express Cry1)
  Mechanism: radical pair
    via photoexcitation of
    FAD-tryptophan pair
  Light required: UV-A/blue
    (380-420 nm)
  Compass type: inclination
    (angle of field, not polarity)
```

The avian cryptochrome (Cry4)
used by robins and blackcaps
in the Engels and Mouritsen/
Hore experiments is structurally
distinct from monarch Cry1.
Different molecular structures
produce different hyperfine
coupling constants, which
determine different radical
pair resonance frequencies.

Theoretical calculations for
FAD-based radical pairs place
dominant hyperfine couplings
in the 1-10 MHz range for
avian cryptochrome. Monarch
Cry1 hyperfine coupling
constants have not been
precisely characterized.
If they differ from avian
values — even by a factor
of 10 — the resonance
frequencies shift accordingly.

**The monarch-specific RF
disruption frequency has never
been experimentally determined.**

This is not a gap that weakens
the hypothesis. It is a gap
that prevents ruling FM out.
The absence of a measurement
is not evidence that FM does
not disrupt monarch Cry1.
It is evidence that the
experiment has not been done.

---

### Response 3 (logical):
### Engels did not test FM
### frequencies

The Engels 2014 shielding
experiment attenuated
electromagnetic noise in the
50 kHz–5 MHz range because
that is what urban electrosmog
contains. The experiment tested:

```
Question asked:
  Does attenuating urban
  electrosmog (kHz-5 MHz)
  restore robin compass?

Answer: Yes.

Question NOT asked:
  Does FM-frequency (88-108 MHz)
  exposure disrupt robin compass?

That experiment was not
performed in 2014.
```

The conclusion from Engels
is correctly stated as:
"kHz–5 MHz urban electrosmog
disrupts robin compass."

It is incorrectly stated as:
"FM frequencies do not disrupt
bird compass."

That second statement does not
follow from the Engels experiment.
It requires a separate experiment
that was not performed until
Mouritsen & Hore 2023.

---

### Response 4 (quantitative):
### Field strength gap —
### the honest limitation

**The Mouritsen & Hore 2023
experiments used ~50 nT
oscillating fields.**

FM transmitters at ground level
at migration distances produce:

```
At 10km from 100kW transmitter:
  ~1-5 nT oscillating magnetic
  field component

At 50km from 100kW transmitter:
  ~0.1-0.5 nT

Experimental disruption
threshold (2023): ~50 nT
```

This represents a gap of
roughly 10-500× between
ambient FM field strengths
at migration distances and
the experimentally confirmed
disruption threshold.

**This is a genuine limitation.
State it clearly.**

Three factors may partially
bridge this gap:

```
Factor 1: Exposure duration.
  Laboratory experiments use
  seconds to minutes of
  exposure. A migrating monarch
  flies for hours through
  a persistent FM landscape.
  Whether prolonged low-level
  exposure produces equivalent
  disruption to brief high-level
  exposure is not established
  but is biologically plausible
  given that radical pair
  reactions are cumulative
  over time.

Factor 2: Near-field exposure.
  Monarchs roost at night
  and migrate by day. Roosting
  trees within 1-5km of high-
  power FM transmitters receive
  field strengths 5-50x higher
  than the 50km calculation.
  The Norman/OKC tagging site
  (9,482 monarchs) is within
  a major FM broadcast market —
  some roost sites will be
  within 2-5km of transmitters.

Factor 3: Directionality
  amplification.
  Even sub-threshold compass
  disruption may not produce
  random orientation. It may
  produce biased orientation
  toward the false attractor
  — a partial deflection rather
  than complete scrambling.
  Partial deflection at the
  population level over 9 years
  would produce detectable
  alignment signal even if
  individual disruption is weak.
```

**The field strength gap is
the most important unresolved
quantitative question in the
mechanistic chain. It is the
specific experiment that needs
to be done: expose tethered
monarchs to calibrated FM-
frequency fields at ecologically
relevant field strengths and
measure compass orientation.**

That experiment has not been
done. This analysis cannot
wait for it. The pre-registered
statistical test will run on
arrival of recovery data
regardless. If the test is
positive, the field strength
gap becomes the primary
motivation for the follow-up
laboratory experiment. If null,
the gap is a plausible partial
explanation.

## PART V: WHAT IS CONFIRMED,
## WHAT DIVERGES, WHAT IS
## GENUINELY UNKNOWN

### Confirmed and corroborated

```
1. FM broadcast infrastructure
   covers 99.8% of all monarch
   tagging locations in the
   Monarch Watch dataset.

2. Mean FM opposition across
   363,582 tagging records
   is 85.5°. 28.1% of all
   records are at high-risk
   locations (opposition >120°,
   strength >0.01).

3. Monarch magnetic compass
   confirmed, light-dependent,
   Cry1-mediated, inclination
   type, exclusive under overcast.
   (Wan 2021, PLOS ONE 2025)

4. RF disruption of cryptochrome-
   based compass confirmed in
   avian species up to ~116 MHz,
   with 75-85 MHz most disruptive.
   FM band sits 87.5-108 MHz.
   (Mouritsen & Hore 2023)

5. Vector navigation confirmed —
   monarchs cannot correct for
   compass corruption.
   (Mouritsen 2013)

6. SC coastal population shows
   near-zero Mexico recovery rate
   and year-round residency in
   the geographic direction of
   the SC FM false attractor
   bearing (30° NNE).
   (McCord & Davis 2010,
   McCord et al. 2023)

7. Milkweed/glyphosate mechanism
   confirmed as primary driver
   of breeding-stage population
   loss since 1997.
   (Pleasants & Oberhauser 2013)
```

### Genuinely diverging

```
1. Engels 2014 (resolved):
   Originally appeared to show
   FM band above disruption range.
   Resolved by Mouritsen & Hore
   2023 which places FM band
   within the confirmed disruption
   window for avian cryptochrome.

2. Etheredge 1999 retraction
   (resolved):
   Appeared to challenge magnetic
   compass existence. Retraction
   resolved by Wan 2021 and
   PLOS ONE 2025 with properly
   controlled experiments.

3. Taylor 2020 migration mortality
   (neutral, not contradictory):
   Stable migration recovery rate
   does not rule out FM deflection
   — deflected monarchs appear as
   unrecovered tags, not deaths.
```

### Genuinely unknown

```
1. MOST IMPORTANT:
   Monarch-specific FM disruption
   frequency and threshold.
   Cry1 hyperfine coupling
   constants uncharacterized.
   FM-frequency exposure effect
   on tethered monarchs in
   controlled arena not tested.
   This is the critical missing
   experiment.

2. SC population origin date.
   If the SC resident non-
   migratory population formed
   recently (post-1960 FM
   buildout) rather than being
   a long-standing distinct
   population, that would be
   additional circumstantial
   evidence. Population genetics
   not yet published for this
   question.

3. Historical FM database.
   Year-specific FCC license
   data would allow computing
   the FM landscape at the time
   of each tagging event (1992-
   2000) rather than using the
   2026 database. This would
   eliminate the temporal
   mismatch limitation and
   potentially reduce measurement
   error attenuation.

4. Kansas/Oklahoma mechanistic
   separation.
   Milkweed loss and FM
   opposition are geographically
   confounded in KS/OK. An
   experiment or natural
   experiment separating the
   two effects in these states
   has not been designed.

5. Recovery coordinates from
   1992-2000.
   The primary pre-registered
   test. Pending Monarch Watch
   data response.

## PART VI: MANUSCRIPT-READY
## LANGUAGE

### For the introduction
### (mechanistic backbone)

```
"The monarch butterfly magnetic
compass operates via the radical
pair mechanism in Cry1 cryptochrome,
expressed in both antennae and
eyes (Wan et al. 2021). This
compass is the exclusive orientation
mechanism under overcast conditions
(PLOS ONE 2025). Oscillating
radiofrequency (RF) fields disrupt
cryptochrome-based radical pair
compass orientation in migratory
birds at frequencies up to
approximately 116 MHz, with the
75-85 MHz range identified as
maximally disruptive (Mouritsen
& Hore 2023). FM broadcast radio
operates at 87.5-108 MHz — within
the confirmed disruption window.
FM transmitters are distributed
across the monarch migration
corridor at densities sufficient
to create directionally non-uniform
RF field environments at all major
tagging locations (this study).
Because monarchs are vector
navigators rather than true
navigators (Mouritsen et al. 2013),
compass corruption cannot be
corrected by positional recalibration
— a corrupted compass bearing
produces confident navigation in
the wrong direction."
```

### For the methods
### (Engels 2014 response)

```
"The Engels et al. (2014)
demonstration of urban electrosmog
disruption at 50 kHz–5 MHz might
appear to preclude FM effects.
However, that study characterized
disruption by the ambient urban
noise spectrum, which does not
include significant FM-frequency
components. The subsequent
Mouritsen & Hore (2023) systematic
frequency sweep found disruption
extending to ~116 MHz, with
75-85 MHz most disruptive and
the FM band (87.5-108 MHz) within
the confirmed disruption window.
The monarch-specific disruption
threshold has not been determined;
the field strength of ambient FM
signals at migration distances
(estimated 0.1-10 nT) is below
experimental thresholds (~50 nT),
a limitation we acknowledge and
that motivates follow-up laboratory
experiments."
```

### For the discussion
### (SC corroboration)

```
"Independent corroboration of the
predicted directional outcome is
available for the South Carolina
tagging sites. McCord & Davis (2010)
documented a near-zero Mexico
recovery rate (0.023%) at a 13-year
SC coastal stopover study, and McCord
et al. (2023) confirmed a year-round
resident population cycling between
coastal sea islands (winter) and
inland swamps (breeding). The FM
false attractor bearing at the SC
tagging site (32.66°N, 79.94°W)
is 30° (NNE), directed toward the
coastal sea island habitats where
the non-migratory SC population
has been documented. These two
datasets — FM infrastructure
geometry and 13 years of tagging
records — were generated
independently and neither was
designed with the other in mind.
Their directional agreement does
not establish causation but
constitutes independent corroboration
of the predicted geographic
outcome."
```

## PART VII: PRIORITY NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (pre-recovery data)

```
1. Monarch Watch response.
   Email sent February 28, 2026.
   When recovery data arrives:
   run pipeline once, report
   regardless of outcome.

2. SC finding → OSF amendment.
   The SC independent corroboration
   finding should be added to the
   OSF project wiki as a post-
   registration discovery note.
   It is not part of the pre-
   registered hypothesis but is
   important context for the
   SC-specific secondary analysis.

3. Mouritsen & Hore 2023 →
   add to pre-registration
   literature context.
   File as OSF wiki note citing
   this paper as the resolution
   of the Engels 2014 frequency
   challenge.
```

### After recovery data arrives

```
4. Run primary statistical test.
   V-test on alignment_angle.
   Report regardless of outcome.

5. If positive:
   Contact Mouritsen lab
   (University of Oldenburg)
   and Merlin lab (Texas A&M)
   about follow-up FM-frequency
   monarch orientation experiment.
   This is the missing Link 5
   in the mechanistic chain.

6. If positive:
   Contact McCord (SCDNR) about
   SC population genetics.
   Population formation date
   relative to FM buildout is
   testable with genetic analysis.
```

### Second species

```
7. Sea turtle AM attractor
   analysis.
   The attractor pollution
   framework applies to sea
   turtles using AM band
   magnetoreception.
   NOAA stranding database +
   FCC AM transmitter coordinates
   = same pipeline, different
   species.
   Can begin before monarch
   recovery data arrives.
```

---

## PART VIII: THE ONE PARAGRAPH
## SUMMARY OF WHERE THIS STANDS

The FM false attractor hypothesis
for monarch butterfly navigation
disruption now rests on a
mechanistic chain that is
confirmed at both ends and has
one quantitative gap in the
middle. The compass exists and
uses the right cryptochrome.
The frequency range of RF
disruption for cryptochrome-
based compasses in migratory
species has been measured and
includes the FM band. Monarchs
cannot correct for compass
corruption because they are
vector navigators. The predicted
geographic outcome — monarchs
failing to complete migration
to Mexico and ending up in the
direction of the FM false
attractor — has been independently
documented at the highest-FM-
strength site in the dataset
by 13 years of published tagging
data. The one gap is field
strength: ambient FM fields at
migration distances are estimated
to be 10-500× below experimental
disruption thresholds, and the
monarch-specific threshold has
not been measured. The
pre-registered statistical test
on 1992-2000 recovery coordinates
is the next event in the
evidence chain. Whatever that
test returns — positive, null,
or unexpected — it will be
reported in full.
