## PREAMBLE

This document records a framework
shift in the OrganismCore
electromagnetic navigation series.
It is not a revision of prior
results. All prior results stand
as reported. This document
reframes what those results mean
and changes what the analyses
are looking for going forward.

The shift is from:

  DOSE FRAMEWORK
  (EM fields damage or disrupt
   biological function in
   proportion to intensity)

To:

  COHERENCE FRAMEWORK
  (EM fields function as
   environmental reference signals
   that organisms incorporate into
   self-models; their effect depends
   on stability, persistence, and
   spatial structure — not dose)

This is not a minor reframing.
It changes the predicted direction
of effects, the relevant
experimental variables, and the
interpretation of existing results.

---

## PART I: THE DOSE FRAMEWORK
## AND WHY IT IS WRONG FOR
## THIS PROBLEM

### What the dose framework assumes

```
Assumption 1:
  EM fields interact with biological
  tissue as a physical perturbation.
  More field = more perturbation =
  more effect.

Assumption 2:
  The relevant biological outcome
  is damage or disruption —
  disrupted LTP, impaired radical
  pair chemistry, heated tissue,
  induced currents.

Assumption 3:
  The organism is a passive receiver.
  The field acts on it.
  It does not act on the field.
  It does not model the field.

Assumption 4:
  A field-free environment is the
  neutral baseline. Any field is
  a deviation from neutral.
  Larger deviation = worse outcome.
```

### Where the dose framework fails

```
FAILURE 1 — THE IMPC RESULT:
  If dose drove the effect, high-ELF
  facilities should produce more
  impaired, more anxious mice.
  The data shows the opposite.
  High-ELF facilities produce
  LESS anxious, MORE exploratory
  mice.

  Dose framework prediction: WRONG.
  Direction is inverted.

FAILURE 2 — THE MONARCH CORRIDOR:
  If dose drove disorientation,
  monarchs tagging near strong FM
  towers should show the most
  bearing deviation. The circular-
  linear correlation test showed
  FM strength and opposition angle
  are essentially independent
  (r_cl=0.043, p=0.055).
  Strong signals are not more
  disruptive than weak ones.

  Dose framework prediction: WRONG.
  Strength does not predict
  opposition.

FAILURE 3 — PUBLISHED LITERATURE:
  Acute high-intensity ELF impairs
  hippocampal LTP and spatial
  memory. Chronic low-level ELF
  sometimes produces anxiolysis.
  The same physical variable
  produces opposite behavioral
  outcomes depending on duration,
  intensity, and developmental
  timing.

  The dose framework has no
  principled account of this
  reversal. It treats it as
  a dose-response nonlinearity
  without explaining why the
  direction reverses.

FAILURE 4 — THEORETICAL:
  The dose framework treats
  organisms as passive receivers
  of a physical perturbation.
  But organisms have nervous
  systems. Nervous systems model
  environments. Models can
  incorporate signals that are
  stable and persistent. A signal
  that is incorporated into a
  model is no longer a perturbation.
  It is reference.

  The dose framework has no
  category for this.
```

---

## PART II: THE COHERENCE
## FRAMEWORK

### Core claims

```
CLAIM 1: ORGANISMS BUILD
SELF-MODELS FROM PERSISTENT
ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNALS

  The nervous system does not
  simply react to environmental
  inputs. It builds a model of
  the environment — including
  its EM structure — and uses
  that model to predict and
  navigate.

  Any signal that is:
    — persistent (present over
      the organism's lifetime
      or developmental period)
    — stable (not randomly
      fluctuating)
    — spatially structured
      (different in different
       places in a predictable way)

  ...will be incorporated into
  the organism's self-model as
  a reference signal.

  Once incorporated, the signal
  is not a perturbation.
  It is part of the model.

CLAIM 2: DISRUPTION IS NOT DOSE —
DISRUPTION IS INCOHERENCE

  The relevant variable is not
  how strong the EM field is.
  The relevant variable is how
  well the organism's model
  of the EM environment matches
  the actual EM environment it
  is currently in.

  COHERENCE:
    Model matches environment.
    Navigation is confident.
    Behavior is exploratory.
    Low thigmotaxis. Low anxiety.

  INCOHERENCE:
    Model does not match
    environment.
    Navigation is uncertain.
    Behavior is defensive.
    High thigmotaxis. High anxiety.
    Bearing deviation in migration.

  Incoherence can be produced by:
    (a) Sudden removal of a
        familiar signal (Faraday
        cage, facility relocation)
    (b) Introduction of a competing
        signal that contradicts
        the model (FM false attractor
        bearing opposing true
        migration heading)
    (c) Rapid spatial variation
        in the signal (high FM
        bearing rate of change
        along migration path)
    (d) Loss of the organizing
        signal in a social system
        (queen death in naked
        mole rat colony)

  All four are the same logical
  structure: the reference signal
  that organized the model is
  disrupted, absent, or contradicted.

CLAIM 3: THE TRIADIC STRUCTURE

  The framework has three nodes:

    ORGANISM ←→ ENVIRONMENT
         ↘         ↙
          SELF-MODEL

  The self-model is built from
  the organism's sensory history
  of the environment. It is not
  a passive record. It is an
  active prediction engine that
  continuously compares incoming
  signal to expected signal.

  When incoming matches expected:
    Prediction error is low.
    Confidence is high.
    Behavior is exploratory.

  When incoming contradicts expected:
    Prediction error is high.
    Confidence is low.
    Behavior is defensive/anxious.

  The EM environment is one layer
  of this model among others
  (visual, olfactory, thermal,
  gravitational). But for organisms
  with magnetosensory systems
  (monarchs, possibly mice via
  unidentified low-frequency
  magnetoreception), the EM layer
  is a primary navigational
  reference.

CLAIM 4: PERSISTENCE IS THE
NECESSARY CONDITION

  For an EM signal to be
  incorporated into the self-model,
  it must be persistent across
  the organism's developmental
  period.

  A signal that begins after
  development is complete is
  experienced as a perturbation,
  not as reference.

  A signal present from birth
  or hatching is experienced as
  reference, not as perturbation.

  This is why:
    — BCM mice (born into high-ELF)
      show low thigmotaxis.
      The field is their baseline.
    — Acute experimental ELF
      exposure in adult mice
      produces disruption.
      The field is not their
      baseline. It is noise.

  The same field, in the same
  animal, with the same nervous
  system, produces opposite
  behavioral effects depending
  on whether it was present
  during development.

  Dose cannot account for this.
  Persistence can.
```

### The naked mole rat analogy
### — made precise

```
Queen death in a naked mole rat
colony produces colony collapse:
  — Increased conflict
  — Loss of coordinated foraging
  — Reproductive chaos
  — Individual behavioral
    disorientation

The queen does not die from an
overdose of her own pheromone.
Her pheromone is not a toxin.
It is an organizing signal.
The colony's behavior is built
around the queen's signal as
a reference.

When the reference is removed,
the colony's behavioral model
becomes incoherent. Each
individual loses the signal
that organized its model of
the social environment.

The collapse is not damage.
The collapse is the loss of
reference.

Mapping to the EM series:

  Queen's pheromone
    → persistent, stable,
      spatially structured signal
    → incorporated into colony
      members' behavioral models
      as reference
    → removal causes incoherence

  Facility ELF field
    → persistent (lifetime),
      stable (infrastructure-based),
      spatially structured
      (differs by facility)
    → incorporated into mouse
      self-model as EM reference
    → removal (Faraday cage)
      or replacement (relocation)
      should cause incoherence
      → increased thigmotaxis

  FM broadcast landscape
    → persistent (towers are fixed),
      spatially structured
      (coverage varies by location)
    → potentially incorporated
      into monarch compass model
      as EM background
    → spatial incoherence
      (bearing rate of change,
       competing false attractors)
      disrupts navigation

  All three are the same structure.
  All three are instances of
  Claim 2: disruption is not dose,
  disruption is incoherence.
```

## PART III: WHAT THIS CHANGES
## FOR THE MONARCH ANALYSIS

### The old question

```
OLD QUESTION:
  Do monarchs near strong FM towers
  with bearings opposed to the
  migration direction show more
  bearing deviation in their
  recoveries?

  Independent variable:
    Static opposition angle at
    tagging location.
    (FM bearing vs expected
     migration bearing)

  Dependent variable:
    Recovery bearing deviation.

  Implicit assumption:
    The tower acts on the monarch
    at the tagging location.
    Stronger signal + worse
    opposition = more disruption.
```

### Why the old question is wrong

```
Under the coherence framework,
the static opposition angle at
the tagging location is not the
relevant variable. Here is why:

A monarch that has been flying
for three weeks from Ontario has
been continuously building and
updating its EM spatial model
as it moves through changing
landscapes.

The relevant question is not
what the FM field is doing at
one tagging location.

The relevant question is what the
FM field has been doing across
the entire path from origin to
tagging location, and what it
will do from tagging location to
overwintering site.

The field the monarch has
experienced is a trajectory
through EM space, not a point
measurement.

A monarch that has flown through
a stable, slowly-changing FM
landscape has a coherent EM
model of the corridor.

A monarch that has flown through
a rapidly-changing, spatially
incoherent FM landscape —
towers pointing in different
directions, signals competing,
bearing changing sharply per km
traveled — has an incoherent
model.

The incoherent-model monarch
will show more bearing deviation.
Not because any one tower
disrupted its compass.
Because the landscape it traveled
through failed to provide a
coherent EM reference from which
to build a reliable model.
```

### The new question

```
NEW PRIMARY QUESTION:
  Do monarchs that traveled through
  FM landscapes with high spatial
  incoherence show more bearing
  deviation in their recoveries
  than monarchs that traveled
  through FM landscapes with low
  spatial incoherence?

  Independent variable:
    FM SPATIAL COHERENCE along
    the monarch's traveled path
    from origin to tagging location.

    Operationalized as:
      FM bearing rate of change
      (degrees per km of southward
       travel) — how fast the false
       attractor bearing shifts as
       the monarch moves through
       the landscape.

      High rate of change =
        incoherent FM landscape =
        rapidly shifting false signal =
        model-disrupting

      Low rate of change =
        coherent FM landscape =
        slowly varying false signal =
        incorporable as reference
        OR ignorable as stable
        background

  Secondary variable:
    FM bearing rate of change
    AHEAD of the tagging location
    (from tagging to overwintering).
    This measures the incoherence
    the monarch is about to
    fly into.

  Dependent variable:
    Recovery bearing deviation.
    Same as before.

  Prediction:
    HIGH coherence path (low rate
    of change) → LOW bearing
    deviation. Monarch has a
    stable EM model and uses it
    to navigate accurately.

    LOW coherence path (high rate
    of change) → HIGH bearing
    deviation. Monarch's EM model
    is confused by competing,
    shifting signals.
```

### What stays the same

```
The infrastructure is unchanged:
  — Tagging locations (N=3,099)
  — FM tower database
  — Expected migration bearings
  — Recovery location data
    (pending from Monarch Watch)

The Rayleigh test result stands:
  The FM landscape is non-randomly
  oriented across the corridor.
  This is a property of the
  landscape, not of any individual
  monarch. It stands regardless
  of the framework.

The permutation clustering result
stands:
  High-risk locations cluster in
  the northwest quadrant.
  This is a geographic fact about
  the FM infrastructure.

What changes is the METRIC
computed from the FM data
and the HYPOTHESIS being tested
against recovery bearings.
```

### The new metric — FM spatial
### coherence

```
For each tagging location,
compute:

  1. The monarch's likely path
     from its origin (latitude-
     matched northern starting
     point) to its tagging
     location. Approximate this
     as a geodesic southward
     track.

  2. Along that path, at intervals
     of 10km, compute the FM false
     attractor bearing — the
     direction of the dominant FM
     signal at each waypoint.

  3. Compute the bearing rate of
     change: how many degrees does
     the false attractor bearing
     shift per 100km of southward
     travel?

  4. Assign each tagging location
     a PATH COHERENCE SCORE:
       Low score = high rate of
         change = incoherent path
       High score = low rate of
         change = coherent path

  5. Test whether PATH COHERENCE
     SCORE predicts recovery
     bearing deviation.

This replaces the static
opposition angle as the primary
independent variable.

The static opposition angle
becomes a secondary variable —
it may still matter as a measure
of the mismatch between the
monarch's model and its current
location, but the path coherence
score is the primary predictor
under the coherence framework.
```

### The forward coherence variable

```
In addition to path coherence
(what the monarch has experienced),
compute FORWARD COHERENCE:

  From the tagging location to
  the overwintering sites in
  Mexico, how rapidly does the
  FM false attractor bearing
  change per 100km?

  A monarch tagged in a location
  where the remaining corridor
  has high FM spatial coherence
  (slowly varying false attractor
  bearing) should navigate more
  accurately than one facing a
  highly incoherent remaining
  corridor.

  This is the predictive analog
  of the path coherence score —
  one looks backward at what
  built the model, one looks
  forward at what the model
  will encounter.
```

---

## PART IV: WHAT THIS CHANGES
## FOR THE IMPC ANALYSIS

### The old interpretation

```
OLD INTERPRETATION:
  High-ELF facilities produce
  less anxious mice because ELF
  has a dose-dependent anxiolytic
  effect at chronic low levels.

  The correlation was described
  as consistent with chronic
  low-level ELF anxiolysis in
  the published rodent literature.

  This framing is passive and
  dose-based. It treats the mice
  as recipients of a field that
  happens to calm them down.
```

### The new interpretation

```
NEW INTERPRETATION:
  High-ELF facilities produce
  less anxious mice because mice
  born into a stable, persistent,
  high-ELF environment have
  incorporated that field into
  their self-model.

  The field is not calming them.
  The field is part of their
  reference frame. They are
  confident because their model
  is coherent — the environment
  matches what they expect.

  Low-ELF facilities produce
  more anxious mice not because
  low ELF is harmful, but because
  those mice have a sparser EM
  reference frame. Their model
  has less environmental
  scaffolding. In the open field,
  where visual cues are minimal
  and spatial certainty depends
  on internal reference, they
  are less confident.

  The correlation is not a dose
  effect. It is a calibration
  effect. The mice at BCM are
  not less anxious because they
  received more ELF.
  They are less anxious because
  they know where they are.
```

### The new predictions for IMPC

```
PREDICTION 1 — FARADAY RELOCATION:
  Move BCM mice (ELF 94, low
  thigmotaxis) to a Faraday
  shielded cage.
  Thigmotaxis should INCREASE.
  Their model no longer matches
  their environment.
  Anxiety increases not from
  any new dose of anything —
  from the absence of a familiar
  reference signal.

PREDICTION 2 — FACILITY RELOCATION:
  Move BCM mice to UC Davis.
  Short-term: thigmotaxis increases
    sharply (model mismatch).
  Long-term: thigmotaxis recovers
    toward UC Davis baseline
    (new model calibrated to
    low-ELF environment).
  Move UC Davis mice to BCM.
  Short-term: thigmotaxis increases
    (model mismatch — even though
    the new environment is richer).
  Long-term: thigmotaxis decreases
    toward BCM baseline (new model
    incorporates high-ELF reference).

  CRITICAL PREDICTION:
  Both directions of relocation
  produce SHORT-TERM thigmotaxis
  INCREASE. This is the signature
  of a coherence effect. A dose
  effect would predict that moving
  from low to high ELF increases
  thigmotaxis while moving from
  high to low decreases it.
  The coherence effect predicts
  the same direction for both:
  any relocation disrupts the
  model → anxiety increases.

PREDICTION 3 — DEVELOPMENTAL
WINDOW:
  Offspring born in shielded cages
  (no ELF from conception) should
  show higher thigmotaxis than
  offspring born in standard BCM
  caging — even though the shielded
  offspring have never been exposed
  to high ELF and therefore cannot
  have been disrupted by its removal.
  They simply built their model
  without the EM scaffold.
  Their model is thinner.
  Their spatial confidence is lower.

PREDICTION 4 — THE WITHIN-FACILITY
GRADIENT:
  Within a single large facility
  like BCM or the Texas Medical
  Center complex, there are spatial
  gradients in ELF — some rooms
  are closer to transformers, MRI
  suites, high-current equipment.
  Mice housed in higher-ELF rooms
  within the same facility should
  show lower thigmotaxis than mice
  housed in lower-ELF rooms —
  controlling for all other
  variables including strain, sex,
  litter, and handler.
  This is the tightest possible
  test of the coherence hypothesis
  because it eliminates all
  facility-level confounds.
```

---

## PART V: WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE

```
THE PRIMARY RESULTS STAND:

  Monarch FM analysis:
    Rayleigh p=0.0005 stands.
    Permutation clustering stands.
    Watson-Williams ns stands.
    The framework reframes what
    to look for in recovery bearings.
    It does not invalidate
    existing results.

  IMPC OFD:
    r=-0.886, p=0.019 stands.
    The framework reinterprets why
    the correlation is in the
    anxiolytic direction.
    It does not change the numbers.

THE NULL RESULTS ARE REINTERPRETED:

  Fear conditioning null:
    Under the old framework, this
    was interpreted as ELF not
    affecting hippocampal memory.
    Under the coherence framework,
    this is expected: contextual
    fear conditioning is primarily
    a test of MEMORY, not of
    spatial confidence. A coherent
    self-model does not improve
    associative memory — it improves
    navigational confidence. The
    null is predicted.

  PPI non-significant:
    Under the coherence framework,
    sensorimotor gating is only
    weakly predicted to correlate
    with EM coherence. The trend
    from ELF 31→67 is interesting
    but the non-linearity at BCM
    remains unexplained by either
    framework.
```

---

## PART VI: THE THEORETICAL
## LINEAGE

```
This framework connects to several
existing theoretical traditions
without being reducible to any
of them:

PREDICTIVE PROCESSING /
ACTIVE INFERENCE:
  The self-model as a prediction
  engine that minimizes prediction
  error. EM coherence reduces
  prediction error in the spatial
  domain. Incoherence increases
  prediction error → defensive
  behavior.
  (Friston, 2010; Clark, 2016)

UMWELT THEORY:
  Each organism inhabits a
  species-specific perceptual
  world constructed from the
  sensory signals it is built
  to detect. The EM environment
  is part of the umwelt for
  magnetosensory organisms.
  Its structure shapes the
  organism's model of space.
  (von Uexküll, 1909)

EMBODIED COGNITION:
  The self-model is not stored
  in the brain alone. It is
  distributed across the organism-
  environment interface. The
  environment provides scaffolding
  for cognition. Remove the scaffold
  and cognition degrades — not
  because the brain is damaged
  but because the extended
  cognitive system loses part
  of itself.
  (Clark & Chalmers, 1998)

MORPHIC RESONANCE / FIELD
THEORIES OF MIND:
  Not invoked here. The coherence
  framework is mechanistic and
  does not require non-local
  effects. The EM field is a
  physical signal. The self-model
  is a neural computation. The
  connection is standard
  sensory neuroscience plus
  developmental calibration.

THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION OF
THIS FRAMEWORK:
  The coherence framework is
  distinguished from all of the
  above by its specific claim
  about EM signals as
  environmental reference:

  1. EM fields are not neutral
     background. They are
     sensory input for organisms
     with magnetosensory systems.

  2. Persistent EM signals are
     incorporated into self-models
     during development as
     calibration reference.

  3. The behavioral consequence
     of EM disruption is not
     biological damage but
     model incoherence —
     a mismatch between the
     organism's spatial model
     and its current EM environment.

  4. The relevant variable is
     not dose but coherence:
     the degree to which the
     EM environment the organism
     currently inhabits matches
     the EM environment in which
     its model was built.
```

---

## PART VII: FALSIFIABILITY

```
The coherence framework makes
predictions that are:
  (a) Different from the dose
      framework
  (b) Internally consistent
  (c) Testable with existing
      infrastructure

STRONG FALSIFIERS:

  1. If Faraday-relocated BCM mice
     show DECREASED thigmotaxis
     (not increased), the coherence
     framework is falsified for
     IMPC mice. Dose framework
     would be supported.

  2. If both directions of facility
     relocation (high→low AND
     low→high ELF) do NOT show
     short-term thigmotaxis increase,
     the coherence framework is
     falsified. Dose framework
     predicts asymmetric response.

  3. If monarch recovery bearing
     deviation correlates with
     static FM signal strength
     but NOT with FM bearing
     rate of change along the
     path, the coherence framework's
     specific prediction for
     monarchs is falsified.

  4. If developmental shielding
     (born in Faraday cage) does
     NOT produce higher thigmotaxis
     than same-facility controls,
     Claim 4 (persistence as
     necessary condition) is
     falsified.

NON-FALSIFYING OUTCOMES:

  Fear conditioning null:
    Predicted by coherence framework.
    Does not falsify or confirm.

  PPI non-significance:
    Not strongly predicted by
    coherence framework.
    Does not falsify or confirm.

## VERSION AND STATUS

```
v1.0 — February 27, 2026

Theoretical Document 1 of the
OrganismCore series.

Status: ACTIVE FRAMEWORK
  Replaces dose framework as
  primary interpretive lens
  for all subsequent analyses
  in the series.

  Prior documents are not
  revised. They are reread
  through this lens.

Immediate analytical consequences:

  Monarch Analysis 1:
    Add FM bearing rate of change
    metric to the analysis pipeline.
    This becomes the primary
    independent variable for
    the V-test when Monarch Watch
    data arrives.
    Static opposition angle
    becomes secondary.

  IMPC Analysis 3:
    Faraday cage experiment
    designed as the primary
    experimental test of the
    coherence hypothesis.
    Facility relocation experiment
    designed as secondary test.
    Developmental window experiment
    designed as tertiary test.

  All future analyses in the series
  use coherence (model-environment
  match) as the primary variable,
  not dose (field intensity).
```
