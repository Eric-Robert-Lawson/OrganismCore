  This document makes a theoretical
  claim that is stated as a
  candidate unification, not a
  confirmed result. It is held
  as a reasoning tool and a
  guide for pre-registration
  framing. It will be tested
  implicitly by the convergence
  or divergence of results across
  the three analyses it connects.

the_claim_in_one_sentence:
  The relevant variable in all
  three EM analyses is not
  electromagnetic field magnitude —
  it is the coherence of the EM
  signal relative to the self-model
  the organism built during
  development or travel, and
  disruption occurs when that
  coherence is broken, not when
  the magnitude crosses a threshold.

origin_of_this_document:
  This unification was stated
  explicitly for the first time
  in a working session on
  February 27, 2026, in the
  following observation:

  "Coherence and false attractors
  are connected in my viewpoint.
  For instance the strength of a
  false attractor in a space for
  which we navigate, we measure
  coherence through the navigation
  of that space, whereby the false
  attractors accumulate through
  the travelling of the space,
  rather than any moment within
  the travelling."

## PART I: THE VARIABLE THAT
## WAS IMPLICIT IN THREE ANALYSES

### What each analysis was
### actually measuring

The three analyses in the
OrganismCore EM series appear
to be testing different things:

```
IMPC ANALYSIS:
  Apparent question: Does ambient
  ELF field level correlate with
  anxiety-like behavior in mice?

MONARCH ANALYSIS:
  Apparent question: Does FM
  broadcast infrastructure
  deflect monarch migration
  bearings?

SEA TURTLE ANALYSIS:
  Apparent question: Does AM
  broadcast infrastructure
  produce false attractor bearings
  in sea turtle navigation?
  Does submarine cable magnetic
  anomaly corrupt natal address
  writing during frenzy swims?
```

These look like three different
questions about three different
species tested through three
different methods.

They are not.

They are the same question
asked of three different
navigational systems:

```
THE SINGLE QUESTION:

  What happens to a navigating
  organism when the EM signal
  it uses as reference becomes
  incoherent relative to the
  model it built from that signal?
```

The three analyses are three
instances of this question.
The apparent differences are
differences in the class of
navigator, not differences
in the underlying variable.

---

## PART II: THE TWO CLASSES
## OF NAVIGATOR

### Fixed-space navigators
### vs traveling navigators

The key distinction that makes
the three analyses look different:

```
CLASS 1: FIXED-SPACE NAVIGATOR

  The organism navigates a
  stable, bounded space.
  The EM environment it inhabits
  does not change as it moves
  through its daily range.

  The self-model is built on
  a STABLE signal.

  Coherence = stability of the
  signal within the fixed space.

  Disruption = the stable signal
  is removed or changed.

  The Faraday cage is the
  experimental instantiation
  of this disruption:
  the entire background signal
  the model was built on
  is attenuated.

  EXAMPLE: IMPC mice.
  BCM mouse. Fixed facility.
  High ambient ELF. Stable.
  Self-model built on stable
  high-ELF signal.
  Faraday cage removes it.
  Model-environment mismatch.
  Thigmotaxis increases.


CLASS 2: TRAVELING NAVIGATOR

  The organism navigates a
  changing space.
  The EM environment changes
  with every kilometer traveled.

  The self-model is built on
  an EXPECTED GRADIENT —
  the rate and direction of
  change of the EM signal
  as the organism moves
  toward its target.

  Coherence = integrity of
  the expected gradient over
  the traveled path.

  Disruption = a false attractor
  bends the gradient away from
  the geomagnetic target.
  The deviation ACCUMULATES
  over distance traveled.
  It is not a perturbation
  at one moment. It is a
  corruption of the gradient
  experienced across the journey.

  EXAMPLES:
  Monarch butterfly — FM
  false attractor bends the
  gradient across the migration
  corridor.
  Sea turtle — AM false attractor
  bends the gradient during
  open ocean navigation.
  Sea turtle (address) — cable
  anomaly corrupts the gradient
  written during the frenzy swim.
```

---

## PART III: THE CROWDED ROOM —
## THE MAGNITUDE RELATIONSHIP

### Why magnitude is not the
### primary variable

The IMPC observational result
appears to say that high ELF
= low anxiety. This looks like
a magnitude relationship.

It is not.

The correct reading:

```
HIGH AMBIENT ELF + STABLE
= COHERENT.
= LOW ANXIETY.

LOW AMBIENT ELF + STABLE
= COHERENT.
= LOW ANXIETY.

The common factor is STABLE.
Not HIGH.

Both BCM (high ELF, stable)
and UC Davis (low ELF, stable)
animals have coherent self-models.
The difference in their thigmotaxis
proportions reflects a secondary
effect of magnitude on the
contrast threshold — not a
primary effect of magnitude
on coherence.
```

### The crowded room formulation

```
RURAL ANIMAL
(UC Davis equivalent —
low ambient ELF):

  The signal environment is quiet.
  The self-model was built on
  a quiet signal.
  Any new EM source in this
  environment is like a new
  voice in a quiet room.

  CONTRAST IS HIGH.
  The perturbation is immediately
  detectable against the quiet
  background.
  The self-model registers
  mismatch at low perturbation
  thresholds.
  Disruption requires only a
  small perturbation.

URBAN ANIMAL
(BCM equivalent —
high ambient ELF):

  The signal environment is loud.
  The self-model was built on
  a loud, complex signal.
  Any new EM source in this
  environment is like a new
  voice in a crowded room.

  CONTRAST IS LOW.
  Individual perturbations
  are harder to detect above
  the noise floor.
  The self-model was calibrated
  to expect complex signal.
  Disruption requires a larger
  perturbation to cross the
  contrast threshold.

BUT — THE CROWD ITSELF CAN CHANGE:

  If the ENTIRE BACKGROUND shifts —
  if the crowd goes silent,
  or the crowd's character
  changes fundamentally —
  that IS detectable even
  in the urban animal.

  Because it is not one new voice.
  It is the coherence of the
  entire space changing.

  The Faraday cage does not
  add one new voice.
  It removes the entire crowd.

  The BCM mouse's self-model
  was built on the crowd.
  The crowd is gone.
  The incoherence is total.
  Thigmotaxis increases.
```

### The testable magnitude prediction

```
This generates a specific
testable prediction for the
IMPC experimental series:

BCM mice (high ambient ELF,
high coherence baseline)
require a LARGER Faraday
attenuation to produce the
same thigmotaxis increase
as UC Davis mice (low ambient
ELF, lower coherence baseline)
would require.

The disruption threshold
scales with the ambient
coherence level.

Operationally:
  A partial Faraday cage —
  one that attenuates ELF
  by 50% rather than >90% —
  should produce a larger
  thigmotaxis increase in
  UC Davis mice than in
  BCM mice at the same
  attenuation level.

  The UC Davis mouse is more
  sensitive to partial
  attenuation because partial
  attenuation represents a
  larger fractional change
  from its quiet baseline.

  The BCM mouse is less
  sensitive to partial
  attenuation because partial
  attenuation is a smaller
  fractional change from
  its loud baseline.

This is Experiment 4 in the
extended series (within-facility
gradient experiment) — and it
is now derivable from first
principles rather than just
an interesting observation.
```

---

## PART IV: THE TRAVELING ANIMAL —
## ACCUMULATION OVER DISTANCE

### Why false attractors are
### coherence disruptions, not
### just directional errors

The standard framing of a
false attractor: the organism
navigates toward the wrong
target. It ends up in the
wrong place.

This framing is correct but
incomplete.

```
The deeper description:

A false attractor is a source
of EM signal that bends the
gradient the traveling organism
uses to confirm it is on course.

The organism's self-model
contains a prediction:
"as I travel in direction X,
the EM environment should
change in manner Y."

The false attractor bends
manner Y away from what the
model predicts.

The organism is not just
pointed in the wrong direction.

It is accumulating incoherence
with every step:

  At step 1: EM environment
    slightly different from
    model prediction.
    Small prediction error.
    Below threshold.
    Navigation continues.

  At step 10: accumulated
    prediction error larger.
    Still below threshold.
    Navigation continues but
    the model is being updated
    toward the false gradient.

  At step 100: accumulated
    prediction error has
    shifted the animal's
    working model of the
    gradient.
    The animal is now navigating
    toward the false attractor
    not because it was misled
    at one moment but because
    its gradient model was
    corrupted incrementally
    across the journey.

This is why the PATH COHERENCE
METRIC is the correct variable
for the monarch analysis —
not the point-in-time FM
field at the tagging location,
but the coherence of the FM
gradient experienced across
the entire migration path.

The bearing error is the
SYMPTOM. The accumulated
incoherence is the CAUSE.
```

### The formal relationship

```
For a traveling navigator:

  COHERENCE(path) =
    1 - mean(|EM_observed(t)
             - EM_predicted(t)|)
            / EM_range

  Where:
    EM_observed(t) = actual EM
      environment at position t
      along the path
    EM_predicted(t) = EM environment
      the self-model predicts
      at position t given the
      organism's navigational target
    EM_range = the full range
      of EM variation across
      the navigated space

  A perfectly coherent path:
    COHERENCE = 1.0
    The observed gradient matches
    the predicted gradient exactly.
    Navigation is accurate.

  A path with a false attractor:
    COHERENCE < 1.0
    The false attractor introduces
    discrepancy between observed
    and predicted gradient.
    The discrepancy accumulates.
    COHERENCE decreases with
    distance traveled through
    the false attractor's
    influence zone.

  The bearing error at the
  end of the path is a function
  of the accumulated coherence
  loss, not of the instantaneous
  false attractor strength
  at any single point.
```

---

## PART V: THE THREE ANALYSES
## RESTATED UNDER THE UNIFIED
## FRAMEWORK

### IMPC

```
Class: Fixed-space navigator.

The variable being tested:
  Does removal of the stable
  EM signal the animal's
  self-model was built on
  produce behavioral evidence
  of model-environment mismatch?

Coherence disruption mechanism:
  Faraday cage removes the
  entire background signal.
  Total coherence loss for
  a self-model built on that
  background.

Predicted outcome:
  Thigmotaxis increases because
  the animal cannot confirm
  its spatial position against
  its model. It retreats to
  the periphery — the one
  spatial feature that is
  unambiguous regardless of
  EM signal (the wall is
  always the wall).

Magnitude relationship:
  BCM (high ambient, stable):
  coherent. Low thigmotaxis.
  Faraday: coherence destroyed.
  Thigmotaxis increases.

  UC Davis (low ambient, stable):
  also coherent. Also low
  thigmotaxis.
  Faraday: coherence destroyed
  at lower absolute attenuation.
  Thigmotaxis increases —
  and the threshold is lower.
```

### MONARCHS

```
Class: Traveling navigator.

The variable being tested:
  Does the FM false attractor
  bearing at tagging locations
  predict bearing deviation
  in recovered monarchs?

Coherence disruption mechanism:
  FM infrastructure creates
  a gradient that diverges
  from the geomagnetic gradient
  the monarch's model predicts.
  The divergence accumulates
  across the migration corridor.

Predicted outcome:
  Bearing deviation in recovered
  monarchs correlates with
  FM false attractor bearing
  at the tagging location —
  because the FM gradient
  accumulated along the path
  from that location to
  the recovery site bent the
  monarch's working model
  of the correct gradient.

The path coherence metric:
  The mean FM false attractor
  opposition angle across all
  cells in the migration path
  from tagging to recovery is
  the accumulated coherence
  loss variable.
  High opposition = low coherence.
  Low coherence = larger bearing
  deviation.
```

### SEA TURTLES — AM CHANNEL

```
Class: Traveling navigator.

The variable being tested:
  Does AM false attractor
  bearing at stranding locations
  predict the direction from
  which stranded turtles arrived?

Coherence disruption mechanism:
  AM infrastructure creates a
  gradient that diverges from
  the geomagnetic gradient the
  turtle's navigational model
  predicts during return migration
  to natal beach.

  The AM band (530-1700 kHz)
  sits squarely within the
  confirmed disruption window
  (Engels 2014: 50 kHz-5 MHz).
  No frequency gap argument.
  This is the mechanistically
  cleanest channel in the series.

Predicted outcome:
  Stranding locations cluster
  in directions consistent with
  navigation toward AM false
  attractor bearings rather
  than geomagnetic targets.
  Satellite tracking data
  shows trajectory deviations
  in the direction of the
  AM false attractor at the
  turtle's position along
  the track.
```

### SEA TURTLES — CABLE CHANNEL

```
Class: Address writing event.
  (A special case: not ongoing
  navigation but a single
  address-writing event during
  the frenzy swim.)

The variable being tested:
  Does cable magnetic anomaly
  during the frenzy swim
  corrupt the natal address
  written at that moment,
  producing measurable nesting
  site scatter in adults?

Coherence disruption mechanism:
  The cable anomaly superimposes
  a local magnetic signature
  on the ambient field during
  the frenzy swim.
  The address written includes
  the anomaly.
  The "true" address of the
  beach does not include it.
  The written address is
  incoherent with the actual
  geomagnetic address of the
  natal beach.

  This is a one-time coherence
  disruption at address-writing.
  It does not accumulate over
  distance — it is corrupted
  at the moment of writing
  and carried forward for
  20-30 years until the adult
  attempts to navigate back.

Predicted outcome:
  Turtles from cable-adjacent
  beaches show higher nesting
  site scatter than turtles
  from control beaches.
  The scatter is directional:
  displaced along the coast
  in the direction the Earth's
  magnetic gradient produces
  when the cable anomaly is
  added to the ambient field.
```

---

## PART VI: THE UNIFIED STATEMENT

```
CANDIDATE THEORETICAL STATEMENT:

The common variable across all
three analyses — and across
all organisms navigating by
EM signal — is not EM magnitude.

It is the coherence of the EM
signal relative to the self-model
the organism built from that
signal during development or travel.

COHERENCE has two forms
depending on the class of navigator:

FOR FIXED-SPACE NAVIGATORS:
  Coherence = stability of the
  signal within the navigated space.
  Disruption = signal removed
  or changed.
  Behavioral signature = increased
  thigmotaxis, wall-hugging,
  retreat to unambiguous spatial
  features.

FOR TRAVELING NAVIGATORS:
  Coherence = integrity of the
  expected gradient over the
  traveled path.
  Disruption = false attractor
  bends the gradient.
  Disruption accumulates over
  distance traveled.
  Behavioral signature = bearing
  deviation from expected heading,
  accumulating with distance
  through the false attractor
  zone.

THE MAGNITUDE RELATIONSHIP:

  High ambient signal + stable
  = coherent = low disruption
  threshold (any change is
  detectable but the baseline
  is high).

  Low ambient signal + stable
  = coherent = lower disruption
  threshold (smaller perturbations
  are detectable against the
  quiet background).

  The key variable is the
  contrast of the perturbation
  relative to the coherent
  baseline — not the absolute
  magnitude of either the
  baseline or the perturbation.

  A loud stable environment
  masks small perturbations
  (crowded room effect).
  A quiet stable environment
  amplifies small perturbations
  (quiet room effect).
  A disrupted environment —
  regardless of magnitude —
  produces model-environment
  mismatch and behavioral
  degradation.

THE FALSE ATTRACTOR IS A
COHERENCE DISRUPTION:

  A false attractor does not
  merely point the organism
  in the wrong direction.

  It corrupts the gradient
  the organism uses to confirm
  it is on course.

  The corruption accumulates
  over distance traveled.

  The bearing error at the
  end of the path is the
  integral of the accumulated
  coherence loss along the path —
  not the instantaneous false
  attractor strength at any
  single point.

  This is why path-level metrics
  (path coherence score, mean
  opposition angle across the
  migration corridor) are more
  predictive than point-level
  metrics (FM field strength
  at the tagging location).

THE FARADAY CAGE AND THE FALSE
ATTRACTOR ARE THE SAME DISRUPTION
IN TWO DIFFERENT NAVIGATIONAL
CONTEXTS:

  Faraday cage:
    Removes the coherent background
    from a fixed-space navigator.
    The model no longer matches
    the environment.
    Behavioral degradation follows.

  False attractor:
    Bends the coherent gradient
    away from the expected path
    for a traveling navigator.
    The model no longer matches
    the environment as traversed.
    Navigational error accumulates.

  Both are instances of:
    EM coherence disruption
    relative to a self-model
    that was built on EM coherence.

  The class of navigator determines
  which form the disruption takes.
  The underlying variable —
  coherence loss — is the same.
```

---

## PART VII: WHAT THIS MEANS
## FOR THE SERIES

```
The three analyses are not
independent investigations of
three separate phenomena.

They are three convergent tests
of one hypothesis:

  EM coherence disruption
  relative to the organism's
  self-model produces
  predictable behavioral
  degradation in navigating
  organisms.

If all three analyses produce
results consistent with the
coherence framework:

  The convergent evidence from
  three species, three EM
  channels, two navigational
  classes, and three independent
  datasets constitutes strong
  support for the unified claim.

  No single analysis is
  definitive. Together they
  are.

If one analysis fails to
produce the predicted result:

  The failure must be interpreted
  within the unified framework.
  Was the coherence disruption
  insufficient? Was the navigational
  class misidentified? Was the
  EM channel not the relevant
  one for this species?

  The framework generates
  specific failure-mode hypotheses
  that are themselves testable.

The sea turtle pre-registration
should state this connection
explicitly in its theoretical
background:

  This analysis is not independent
  of the IMPC and monarch analyses.
  It is a third test of the
  same coherence framework,
  applied to a traveling navigator
  using a different EM channel.

  The convergence of results
  across the three analyses
  is the primary evidence
  for the unified claim.
```

## VERSION AND CONNECTIONS

```
v1.0 — February 27, 2026

This document records the
explicit unification of the
three OrganismCore EM analyses
under a single theoretical
variable: EM coherence relative
to the organism's self-model.

The unification was implicit
in the individual analysis
documents. It was made explicit
in a working session on
February 27, 2026, in the
observation that false attractors
and Faraday cages are two
instances of the same disruption
applied to two different classes
of navigator.

This document should be cited
in:
  — The sea turtle pre-registration
    theoretical background section
  — The IMPC Faraday cage protocol
    amended theoretical background
  — Any publication arising from
    any of the three analyses
    that claims the results support
    the coherence framework

The claim this document makes
is not yet tested.
It will be tested by the
convergence or divergence of
the three analyses.

It is held as a reasoning tool,
not a truth claim.

Filed prior to any results
from any of the three analyses.
The timestamp on this document
is the record that the unification
was stated before the results
were known.

That is the point of filing it now.
