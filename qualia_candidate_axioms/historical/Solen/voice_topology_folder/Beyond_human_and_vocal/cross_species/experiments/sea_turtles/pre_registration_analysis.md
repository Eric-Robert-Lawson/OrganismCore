  coherence framework developed
  in the OrganismCore series.

  Prior work:

  OC-OBS-001 (Monarch Analysis):
    Tests whether FM broadcast
    infrastructure false attractor
    bearings predict bearing
    deviation in monarch butterfly
    migration. Pre-registered on
    OSF. Primary V-test pending
    receipt of Monarch Watch
    recovery data.

  OC-EXP-001 (IMPC Faraday):
    Tests whether removal of
    stable ambient ELF signal
    increases thigmotaxis in
    C57BL/6N mice born in a
    high-ELF facility. Pre-
    registered. Pending

    IMPC center.

  Observational foundation:
    IMPC DR23 wildtype C57BL/6N
    thigmotaxis proportion
    correlates negatively with
    facility ELF score across
    six centers.
    Spearman r=-0.886, p=0.019.
    N=16,161 wildtype animals.

  Theoretical unification:

## PART I: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

### The EM coherence framework

```
The coherence framework holds
that organisms navigating by
electromagnetic signal do not
respond to EM magnitude as
a dose.

They respond to the coherence
of the EM signal relative to
the self-model they built from
that signal during development
or travel.

Disruption occurs when coherence
is broken — not when magnitude
crosses a threshold.

Two classes of navigator
experience coherence disruption
in two distinct forms:

CLASS 1 — FIXED-SPACE NAVIGATOR:
  Coherence = stability of signal
    within the navigated space.
  Disruption = signal removed
    or fundamentally changed.
  Behavioral signature = retreat
    to unambiguous spatial features
    (thigmotaxis, wall-hugging).
  Example: IMPC mice in Faraday
    cage (OC-EXP-001).

CLASS 2 — TRAVELING NAVIGATOR:
  Coherence = integrity of the
    expected EM gradient over
    the traveled path.
  Disruption = false attractor
    bends the gradient away from
    the geomagnetic target.
    Disruption accumulates over
    distance traveled.
  Behavioral signature = bearing
    deviation from expected heading,
    accumulating with distance
    through the false attractor
    zone.
  Examples: Monarch butterfly
    (OC-OBS-001). Sea turtle
    (this analysis).

Sea turtles are traveling
navigators. The coherence
disruption mechanism for
traveling navigators applies.

The relevant variable is not
the AM field strength at any
single point. It is the
accumulated coherence loss
across the navigated path —
the degree to which the AM
false attractor bends the
gradient the turtle uses to
confirm it is on course.
```

### The false attractor as
### coherence disruption

```
A false attractor does not
merely point the organism
in the wrong direction.

It corrupts the gradient the
organism uses to confirm it
is on course.

The corruption accumulates
over distance traveled through
the false attractor's influence
zone.

The bearing error observed at
the end of the path — or at
the stranding location — is
the integral of accumulated
coherence loss along the path.

It is not the instantaneous
false attractor strength at
any single position.

This is why path-level metrics
(mean AM opposition angle
across the navigation corridor
from offshore to stranding
location) are more predictive
than point-level metrics
(AM field strength at the
stranding coordinate alone).
```

### The AM broadcast channel

```
The AM broadcast band
(530–1700 kHz) falls squarely
within the confirmed disruption
window for magnetite-based
magnetic compasses:

Engels et al. (2014, PLOS ONE):
  Confirmed compass disruption
  in European robins at frequencies
  from 50 kHz to 5 MHz.
  The entire AM broadcast band
  is within this window.

Mouritsen and Hore (2023, PNAS):
  Extended the confirmed
  disruption range upward to
  116 MHz for radical pair
  compass mechanisms.

Sea turtles use a magnetite-based
magnetic compass for open-ocean
navigation (Lohmann et al.,
multiple publications 1991–2023).

The AM band is therefore within
the confirmed disruption window
for the specific compass
mechanism used by the study
organism.

There is no frequency gap
argument for the AM channel
equivalent to the FM gap
challenge in the monarch
analysis. The AM band sits
in the middle of the confirmed
disruption window. This makes
the sea turtle AM channel
mechanistically the strongest
in the series at this stage
of evidence development.
```

### The natal address mechanism

```
Lohmann et al. (1996, 2004):
  Loggerhead sea turtles use
  a bicoordinate magnetic map —
  combining magnetic field
  inclination and intensity —
  to determine geographic
  position during open-ocean
  navigation.

Putman et al. (2014):
  19-year population-level
  dataset confirms geomagnetic
  natal homing in loggerheads.
  Year-to-year variation in
  the Earth's magnetic field
  predicts year-to-year shifts
  in nesting beach location
  at the population level.
  The magnetic address of the
  natal beach is the navigational
  target for returning adults.

UNC Chapel Hill (February 2025):
  First empirical confirmation
  that loggerhead hatchlings
  can learn and retain specific
  magnetic field signatures as
  location addresses.
  Hatchlings conditioned to
  associate food with specific
  magnetic field parameters
  (inclination + intensity
  combinations) retained the
  association for months.
  The imprinting window is
  the frenzy swim — the period
  immediately after nest emergence
  when the hatchling first
  contacts open ocean.

The UNC 2025 study changes the
status of the magnetic address
corruption hypothesis from
"plausible inference from
migratory behavior" to
"mechanistically grounded
prediction from confirmed
laboratory result."
```

### Why this analysis is
### needed now

```
The UNC 2025 mechanism
confirmation creates a specific,
testable prediction about the
effect of submarine power cable
magnetic anomalies on loggerhead
natal homing.

The FWC individual turtle
nesting database contains
individual-level nesting records
spanning decades — including
records for adults who were
born in the 1995–2006 period
when submarine cable
infrastructure near Florida
nesting beaches was operational.

These turtles are nesting now.

The data to test the prediction
exists in the database.

The question has never been
asked because the mechanism
was not confirmed until
February 2025.

The question can now be asked.

This pre-registration is the
record that the question was
specified before the data
were accessed.

## PART II: HYPOTHESES

### Analysis A — AM False
### Attractor (NOAA Stranding Data)

```
PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS A1:

  Sea turtle stranding locations
  along the Atlantic and Gulf
  coasts of the United States
  show a directional signal
  consistent with navigation
  toward the nearest high-power
  AM broadcast transmitter
  cluster — a false attractor
  bearing — rather than toward
  their geomagnetic navigation
  target.

  Operationally:
    The mean AM false attractor
    opposition angle across all
    loggerhead stranding locations
    in the dataset will be
    significantly less than 90°
    (random expectation).

    Opposition angle = the angle
    between the AM false attractor
    bearing at the stranding
    location and the expected
    geomagnetic navigation bearing
    at that location.

    Opposition angle near 0°:
    stranding direction consistent
    with AM false attractor.
    Opposition angle near 180°:
    stranding direction opposite
    to AM false attractor.
    Opposition angle near 90°:
    no relationship (random).

  Test: Rayleigh test on the
    distribution of opposition
    angles across all stranding
    locations.
    V-test with expected mean
    direction = 0° (consistent
    with AM false attractor).
    Alpha = 0.05.

NULL HYPOTHESIS A0:
  Stranding locations show no
  directional signal consistent
  with AM false attractor bearings.
  Mean opposition angle does not
  differ significantly from 90°.

SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS A2:
  Strandings coded as "unknown
  cause" in the STSSN database
  show lower mean AM false
  attractor opposition angles
  (stronger AM signal) than
  strandings with identified
  causes (boat strike, entanglement,
  disease).

  Rationale: If AM false attractor
  navigation is a cause of
  stranding, it would appear
  in the unknown-cause category
  because the current monitoring
  infrastructure has no field
  for EM navigation disruption.
  Strandings with identified
  physical causes (boat strike)
  should not show the AM signal.

  Test: Mann-Whitney U comparing
    mean opposition angle between
    unknown-cause and known-cause
    strandings.
    Alpha = 0.05.

SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS A3:
  The AM false attractor signal
  is stronger (lower opposition
  angle) in strandings occurring
  during migration seasons
  (April–June for northward
  migration; August–November
  for southward migration and
  nesting return) than in
  strandings occurring outside
  migration seasons.

  Rationale: Navigation disruption
  should be most detectable when
  the animal is actively navigating
  a geomagnetic gradient — not
  when it is resident in a
  feeding area or in cold-stunning
  events.

  Test: Mann-Whitney U comparing
    mean opposition angle between
    migration-season and non-
    migration-season strandings.
    Alpha = 0.05.
```

### Analysis B — Cable Cohort
### Spread (FWC Nesting Data)

```
PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS B1:

  Loggerhead sea turtles whose
  first nesting record (proxy
  natal beach) is within 1 km
  of a submarine power cable
  landing corridor show
  significantly higher geographic
  spread in their nesting
  locations across subsequent
  seasons than loggerhead turtles
  whose first nesting record is
  more than 5 km from any cable
  corridor.

  Operationally:
    Spread = mean great-circle
    distance from each individual's
    nesting locations to that
    individual's nesting centroid,
    computed across all nesting
    records for individuals with
    three or more records.

    Cable cohort: first nesting
    record within 1 km of a
    cable landing corridor approach
    zone (as defined by TeleGeography
    cable route GIS data).

    Control cohort: first nesting
    record more than 5 km from
    any cable corridor.

  Test: Mann-Whitney U test
    (one-tailed: cable spread
    > control spread).
    Alpha = 0.05.

NULL HYPOTHESIS B0:
  No significant difference in
  nesting spread between cable
  cohort and control cohort.

SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS B2:
  The directional displacement
  of cable cohort nesting
  centroids from the expected
  natal beach location is
  consistent with the direction
  the Earth's magnetic gradient
  would produce when the cable's
  estimated field anomaly is
  added to the ambient field.

  Operationally:
    For each cable cohort turtle,
    compute the bearing from the
    first nesting record to the
    mean centroid of all subsequent
    nesting records.
    Compare this bearing to the
    predicted displacement bearing
    from the cable anomaly model.

  Test: Rayleigh test on the
    distribution of displacement
    bearings across cable cohort
    turtles.
    V-test with expected mean
    direction = cable anomaly
    predicted displacement bearing.
    Alpha = 0.05.

  Note: This test requires
    knowledge of cable load
    on the night of each turtle's
    frenzy swim — data that is
    not currently accessible.
    In the absence of cable load
    data, a mean expected anomaly
    based on typical operating
    load will be used and the
    limitation acknowledged.

SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS B3:
  The magnitude of nesting spread
  in the cable cohort correlates
  with the estimated cable field
  anomaly at the beach approach
  corridor — cables with higher
  estimated field anomaly produce
  larger nesting spread in turtles
  from adjacent beaches.

  Test: Spearman correlation
    between estimated cable field
    anomaly (nT, computed from
    cable capacity and burial depth
    estimates) and mean nesting
    spread in the cable cohort
    subgroup associated with each
    cable.
    Alpha = 0.05.
    Minimum 3 cables with at
    least 5 turtle records each
    required for this analysis.
    If this threshold is not met,
    B3 is reported as underpowered
    and deferred.
```

### The combined hypothesis

```
HYPOTHESIS C1 (COMBINED):

  Turtles at high-AM-opposition
  stranding locations AND born
  on beaches adjacent to cable
  corridors represent the highest-
  exposure group in the dataset.

  If both Analysis A and
  Analysis B produce significant
  results, a combined analysis
  will test whether the two
  disruption channels (AM compass
  disruption + cable address
  corruption) show evidence of
  additive or multiplicative
  effect in the subset of turtles
  identifiable in both datasets.

  This is an exploratory analysis.
  No directional prediction is
  pre-registered for the
  interaction term — the direction
  will be determined by whichever
  individual analyses produce
  significant results.

  This analysis is contingent
  on both A1 and B1 being
  significant. If either is null,
  C1 is not run.

```

### AM false attractor
### computation method

```
For each stranding coordinate
(lat, lon):

1. Load all AM transmitters
   within 500 km radius.
   (Beyond 500 km, ground wave
   propagation is negligible
   for AM signal influence
   on navigation.)

2. For each transmitter i:
   Compute bearing from stranding
   location to transmitter:
     bearing_i = atan2(
       sin(lon_i - lon) * cos(lat_i),
       cos(lat) * sin(lat_i) -
       sin(lat) * cos(lat_i) *
       cos(lon_i - lon)
     )

3. Compute effective radiated
   power weight for each transmitter:
     weight_i = ERP_i / distance_i²
   where ERP is estimated from
   FCC power output and HAAT.

4. Compute power-weighted false
   attractor bearing:
     FA_bearing = circular_mean(
       bearing_i, weights=weight_i
     )

5. Compute expected geomagnetic
   navigation bearing:
     geo_bearing = bearing from
     stranding location to
     estimated geomagnetic
     navigation target.
     For return-to-natal-beach
     navigation: bearing toward
     the nearest major Florida
     nesting beach cluster.
     For post-nesting migration:
     bearing toward known
     feeding grounds.
     If navigation phase is
     unknown: use geomagnetic
     north as the null reference.

6. Compute opposition angle:
     opposition = |FA_bearing
                  - geo_bearing|
     Normalized to 0–180°.
     0° = FA bearing and geo
       bearing are identical
       (no opposition — false
       attractor points toward
       correct target, not
       disruptive).
     90° = FA bearing and geo
       bearing are perpendicular
       (random relationship).
     180° = FA bearing points
       directly away from geo
       target (maximum disruption).

   NOTE ON DIRECTIONALITY:
     Unlike the monarch analysis
     where the false attractor
     PULLS the organism toward it,
     the opposition angle here
     measures the degree to which
     the AM signal bends the
     gradient AWAY from the
     geomagnetic target.
     A low opposition angle
     means the AM false attractor
     is pointing in roughly the
     same direction as the
     geomagnetic target —
     low disruption.
     A high opposition angle
     means the AM false attractor
     is pulling in a direction
     that competes with the
     geomagnetic gradient —
     high disruption.

   The primary test asks whether
   strandings cluster at locations
   with HIGH opposition angles —
   i.e., where the AM signal
   most strongly competes with
   the geomagnetic gradient.
```

### Cable corridor classification

```
For Analysis B, each turtle's
proxy natal beach is classified
relative to submarine cable
landing corridors:

CABLE CORRIDOR DEFINITION:
  The cable corridor is the zone
  within 1 km of the cable's
  approach path across the
  nearshore zone — specifically,
  the segment from the 20m
  depth contour to the beach.
  This is the zone where frenzy
  swimming hatchlings would
  be exposed to the cable's
  magnetic field anomaly.

  Proxy for this zone in absence
  of full cable route GIS:
  A 1 km radius around the
  cable landing station coordinate.
  This is a conservative proxy —
  the actual corridor extends
  along the cable approach angle,
  not in all directions.
  Using a radius overestimates
  the corridor width and will
  reduce effect size if the
  true spatial relationship is
  present. This works against
  finding a spurious positive.

CABLE COHORT INCLUSION:
  Turtle's first nesting record
  within 1 km of any power cable
  landing station.

CONTROL COHORT INCLUSION:
  Turtle's first nesting record
  more than 5 km from any power
  cable landing station.

INTERMEDIATE ZONE (excluded):
  Turtle's first nesting record
  between 1 km and 5 km from
  any cable landing station.
  These turtles are excluded
  from the primary analysis.
  They are retained for the
  sensitivity analysis (see
  below).

CABLE TYPE FILTER:
  Only HVDC and HVAC power cables
  are included.
  Fiber optic telecommunications
  cables are excluded.
  The fiber optic cable carries
  negligible current and produces
  negligible magnetic field.
  The power cable carries high
  current and produces a
  measurable magnetic field
  anomaly at the seabed surface.

INSTALLATION YEAR FILTER:
  Only cables installed before
  the estimated frenzy swim
  year of each turtle cohort
  are included.
  A turtle whose first nesting
  record is 2024 (estimated
  birth year ~1994–2004) should
  only be counted as cable-exposed
  if the relevant cable was
  installed before ~2004.
  Cables installed after the
  estimated frenzy swim year
  of a given cohort are not
  included in the corridor
  classification for that cohort.

## PART IV: PRIMARY ANALYSES

### Analysis A — Primary test

```
ANALYSIS A1 — PRIMARY:

  Dataset: NOAA STSSN loggerhead
    strandings, Atlantic and Gulf
    coast, 1990–present.

  Computation: AM false attractor
    opposition angle at each
    stranding coordinate.

  Test 1 — Rayleigh test:
    Is the distribution of
    opposition angles non-uniform?
    A significant Rayleigh test
    indicates that strandings
    are not randomly distributed
    with respect to AM false
    attractor bearings.

  Test 2 — V-test:
    Pre-specified expected direction:
    mean opposition angle
    significantly less than 90°
    (strandings cluster at high-
    disruption locations).
    Alpha = 0.05.

  Reporting:
    Regardless of outcome, the
    full result will be reported:
    mean opposition angle,
    circular SD, Rayleigh R,
    V-test statistic, p-value,
    N strandings included.

  Pre-specified exclusions:
    Cold-stun events (water
    temperature below 10°C at
    stranding date and location)
    are excluded from the primary
    analysis. Cold-stun strandings
    are caused by thermal
    incapacitation, not navigation
    error. They are retained for
    a separate cold-stun vs
    non-cold-stun comparison
    as a specificity check.

    If cold-stun classification
    is not available in the STSSN
    data: exclude all strandings
    north of 35°N latitude in
    November–February as a
    geographic-seasonal proxy.
    This exclusion criterion is
    pre-specified here and will
    not be modified after data
    access.
```

### Analysis B — Primary test

```
ANALYSIS B1 — PRIMARY:

  Dataset: FWC individual
    loggerhead nesting records.

  Classification: cable cohort
    vs control cohort as defined
    in Part III.

  Spread computation:
    For each turtle with ≥3
    nesting records:
    spread_km = mean great-circle
    distance from each nesting
    coordinate to the individual's
    mean nesting centroid.

  Test: Mann-Whitney U test.
    One-tailed: H1 predicts
    cable spread > control spread.
    Alpha = 0.05.

  Effect size: rank-biserial r.
    Reported regardless of
    significance.

  Minimum sample requirement:
    N ≥ 10 turtles in each
    cohort with ≥3 nesting records.
    If this threshold is not
    met, the primary test is
    reported as underpowered
    and the result is exploratory.
    This threshold is pre-specified
    and will not be revised
    after data access.

  Reporting:

## PART V: SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

```
These analyses are pre-specified
and exploratory. They do not
constitute additional primary
tests. Alpha = 0.05 throughout
but results will be interpreted
as hypothesis-generating, not
confirmatory.

SA-1 (ANALYSIS A):
  Re-run primary A1 test
  restricted to strandings within
  50 km of the coastline only.
  Rationale: nearshore strandings
  are more likely to reflect
  final navigation phase toward
  nesting beach. Offshore strandings
  may reflect open-ocean
  navigation phase with different
  geomagnetic reference targets.

SA-2 (ANALYSIS A):
  Re-run primary A1 test
  with 200 km transmitter radius
  and 800 km transmitter radius.
  Rationale: tests sensitivity
  of the false attractor
  computation to the radius
  assumption.

SA-3 (ANALYSIS A):
  Re-run primary A1 test
  restricted to nesting females
  only (if sex is available in
  the STSSN data).
  Rationale: nesting females
  are definitively in the natal
  beach return navigation phase.
  The geomagnetic target is
  unambiguous.

SA-4 (ANALYSIS B):
  Re-run primary B1 test with
  cable corridor threshold at
  500m and at 2 km.
  Rationale: the 1 km threshold
  is a proxy. Testing adjacent
  thresholds assesses whether
  the result is robust to the
  threshold choice or whether
  it appears only at one
  specific threshold (which
  would be suspicious).

SA-5 (ANALYSIS B):
  Include intermediate zone
  turtles (1–5 km from cable)
  and test for a monotonic
  relationship between cable
  proximity and nesting spread.
  Spearman correlation:
  nearest_cable_km vs spread_km.
  Prediction: negative correlation
  (closer to cable = higher spread).

SA-6 (BOTH ANALYSES):
  Re-run all primary tests
  restricted to the Florida
  Atlantic coast only
  (lat 24.5–30.8, lon -80.5
  to -79.8).
  Rationale: highest density
  of both nesting records and
  cable infrastructure. If the
  effect is real, it should be
  strongest here.

## PART VI: WHAT EACH OUTCOME
## MEANS FOR THE SERIES

### If A1 and B1 are both
### supported

```
Two independent datasets.
Two independent disruption
channels (AM compass disruption
and cable address corruption).
Two independent statistical
tests.
Both significant in the
predicted direction.

Implications:

  1. The coherence framework
     is supported in a traveling
     navigator. This extends
     the IMPC fixed-space result
     (OC-EXP-001, if that also
     confirms) to the traveling
     navigator class.

  2. Both EM disruption channels
     active near Florida nesting
     beaches are producing
     detectable effects in
     existing monitoring data.

  3. The FWC disorientation
     database gap identified
     in CS doc 10h is confirmed
     as a meaningful gap:
     the invisible channel was
     carrying a signal that
     the monitoring system was
     not watching.

  4. The unified framework
     (em_coherence_unified_
     framework.md) is supported
     across three species, three
     channels, and two navigational
     classes.

  Publication pathway:
    Primary: Nature Communications
      or Conservation Biology.
    Secondary: Biological
      Conservation (if framed
      primarily as a conservation
      finding).
    Pre-print: bioRxiv immediately
      upon analysis completion,
      before journal submission.
```

### If A1 is supported but
### B1 is null

```
AM compass disruption during
navigation is detectable in
stranding data.

Cable address corruption during
frenzy swim is not detectable
at the current sample size
and spatial resolution.

Possible explanations for
null B1:
  1. Effect is real but too
     small to detect given
     the sample of turtles
     with both ≥3 nesting
     records AND first nesting
     near a cable corridor.
     (Most likely explanation —
     this is a highly filtered
     subset of the database.)

  2. The 1 km cable corridor
     proxy is too imprecise.
     The real effect exists
     within 100m of the cable
     approach path. The 1 km
     proxy includes too many
     unexposed turtles in the
     cable cohort, diluting
     the signal.

  3. Cable address corruption
     does not produce the
     predicted nesting scatter.
     An alternative mechanism
     (e.g., natal beach has
     changed geomagnetically
     due to secular variation)
     accounts for any scatter
     observed. The cable is
     not the cause.

  Report both results honestly.
  Pre-register a follow-up
  cohort analysis with tighter
  spatial threshold when more
  detailed cable route GIS
  is available.
```

### If B1 is supported but
### A1 is null

```
Cable address corruption is
detectable in nesting scatter
data.

AM false attractor is not
detectable in stranding location
data.

Possible explanations for
null A1:
  1. Stranding location is
     not a reliable proxy
     for navigation endpoint.
     Turtles strand for many
     reasons. The AM signal
     is real but the stranding
     database mixes navigation-
     related strandings with
     physical injury, disease,
     and cold-stun events in
     proportions that obscure
     the AM signal.
     → The Movebank trajectory
     analysis becomes the primary
     test for the AM channel.

  2. The AM false attractor
     opposition angle metric
     does not capture the
     correct disruption geometry.
     The computation needs
     revision — possibly the
     disruption operates during
     a specific navigation phase
     not captured by the static
     opposition angle at the
     stranding coordinate.

  3. The AM disruption window
     for sea turtle magnetoreception
     is not 530–1700 kHz.
     The specific receptor
     mechanism in loggerheads
     may have a different
     frequency sensitivity than
     the avian compass system
     from which the frequency
     window is inferred.

  Report both results honestly.
  Pivot to Movebank trajectory
  analysis for the AM channel.
```

### If both are null

```
Neither disruption channel
produces a detectable signal
in the existing databases.

This does not mean the
disruption does not occur.
It means either:

  1. The existing databases
     are not structured to
     detect it. The stranding
     database was built for
     light-induced disorientation.
     The nesting database was
     built for population
     monitoring. Neither was
     built to detect EM
     navigation disruption.
     A null result in databases
     not designed for this
     question is not strong
     evidence against the
     hypothesis.

  2. The effect size is smaller
     than detectable at the
     current sample sizes
     and spatial resolutions.

  3. The coherence framework
     does not apply to sea
     turtles in the way it
     applies to monarchs and
     mice. The magnetic
     navigation system in
     turtles is sufficiently
     robust to AM and cable
     disruption that behavioral
     effects are below detection
     threshold.

  Report the null honestly.
  The pre-registration ensures
  the null is published.
  A null result in a pre-
  registered analysis is a
  result.

## PART VII: DATA MANAGEMENT

```
DATA RECEIPT:
  All data received from NOAA
  STSSN and FWC will be stored
  in a secure local directory
  and backed up to a private
  OSF component before any
  analysis begins.

  The date of data receipt will
  be recorded. No analysis will
  be run before the OSF pre-
  registration is timestamped
  and the data receipt date
  is logged.

PRE-SPECIFIED EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
  ANALYSIS A:
    Exclude: cold-stun events
      (see SA-3 for cold-stun
      specific analysis).
    Exclude: records with
      coordinate precision > 10 km
      (too imprecise for bearing
      computation).
    Exclude: records with
      stranding date before 1990.
    Retain all other records
      regardless of condition
      or outcome.

  ANALYSIS B:
    Exclude: turtles with fewer
      than 3 nesting records.
    Exclude: turtles in the
      intermediate zone (1–5 km
      from cable).
    Exclude: turtles whose
      estimated birth year
      predates the installation
      of any cable in their
      beach segment.
    Retain all other records.

  No exclusions based on the
  dependent variable are
  permitted after data access.

ANALYSIS CODE:
  All analysis code will be
  published in the OrganismCore
  repository before any results
  are reported publicly.
  Scripts already drafted:
    turtle_cohort_analysis.py
    (Analysis B — already in
    CS doc 10h)
  Scripts to be completed
  before data access:
    am_false_attractor_
    computation.py (Analysis A)
    turtle_stranding_pipeline.py
    (Analysis A full pipeline)

OPEN DATA:
  All data will be made publicly
  available upon pre-print
  submission subject to the
  data security requirements
  of NOAA and FWC.
  Individual turtle GPS
  coordinates will not be
  published. Only aggregated
  statistics and anonymized
  individual-level spread
  metrics will appear in
  any publication.
```

## PART VIII: ETHICAL STATEMENT

```
This analysis uses existing
observational records.
No new animals are used.
No field work is required.
No permits beyond data access
agreements are required.

The analysis is desk-based and
retrospective. The ethical
obligation is to the data:
to report all results honestly
regardless of direction, to
handle sensitive location data
responsibly, and to ensure
that null results are published
with the same effort as
positive results.

These obligations are met by:
  — Pre-registration before
    data access.
  — Commitment to full reporting
    in the pre-registration.
  — Open data publication
    subject to FWC/NOAA
    data security requirements.
  — No post-hoc analysis
    presented as pre-specified.
  — All sensitivity analyses
    labeled clearly as exploratory.
```

## PART IX: RELATIONSHIP TO
## UNIFIED FRAMEWORK

```
This analysis is the third
empirical test of the EM
coherence framework stated
in em_coherence_unified_
framework.md (February 27, 2026).

The unified framework holds:

  The relevant variable is not
  EM magnitude. It is the
  coherence of the EM signal
  relative to the self-model
  the organism built during
  development or travel.

  For traveling navigators:
  coherence = integrity of the
  expected gradient over the
  traveled path.

  False attractors disrupt
  coherence by bending the
  gradient. The disruption
  accumulates over distance.
  The bearing error is the
  integral of accumulated
  coherence loss — not the
  instantaneous false attractor
  strength at any single point.

The three analyses in the series
are three convergent tests of
this single claim:

  OC-EXP-001 (IMPC Faraday):
    Fixed-space navigator.
    Coherence disruption by
    signal removal.

  OC-OBS-001 (Monarch FM):
    Traveling navigator.
    Coherence disruption by
    false attractor gradient
    bending.

  OC-OBS-002 (Sea Turtle AM
  + Cable):
    Traveling navigator.
    Two independent disruption
    channels.
    AM: compass coherence
      disruption during navigation.
    Cable: address coherence
      disruption at writing.

The convergence of results
across these three analyses —
if it occurs — is the primary
evidence for the unified claim.

No single analysis is definitive.
Together they are.
