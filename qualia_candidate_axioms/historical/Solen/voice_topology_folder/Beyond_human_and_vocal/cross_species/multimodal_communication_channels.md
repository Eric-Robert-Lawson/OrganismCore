## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The cross-species communication
program has been built primarily
around the vocal/acoustic channel
and the eigenfunction topology of
bounded resonating anatomies.

This is well-founded for cetaceans
and great apes.

But it is incomplete.

Animal communication is multimodal.
Different species have different
dominant channels. Different channels
have radically different properties
for cross-species tractability.

This document does four things:

**1.** Critiques the Social Complexity
Hypothesis (SCH) and replaces it
with a more precise predictor:
**domain navigation depth** across
all pressure axes, not just social
complexity.

**2.** Maps the five primary
communication channels — acoustic,
visual, chemical, behavioral/gestural,
and substrate-borne — against the
eigenfunction framework, assessing
whether each channel has an
eigenfunction structure and whether
that structure is cross-species
tractable.

**3.** Derives the **channel
tractability hierarchy** for
cross-species communication —
which channels are most accessible
to a human sender attempting
to enter a target species'
communication domain.

**4.** Integrates these findings
with the triadic gradient (CS doc 1)
and the Tonnetz topology (CS doc 2)
to produce a complete multimodal
framework for the research program.

**The core finding:**

Vocal topology is the most tractable
entry channel for cross-species
communication — but it is not
sufficient alone for most target
species.

Each species has a **communication
bundle** — a weighted combination
of channels whose joint eigenfunction
space constitutes its full
communication domain.

Cross-species communication requires
entering the communication bundle,
not just one channel within it.

The channels differ in tractability.

The strategy must match the bundle.

## PART I: THE SOCIAL COMPLEXITY
## HYPOTHESIS — CRITIQUE AND
## REPLACEMENT

### 1.1 What The SCH Claims

The Social Complexity Hypothesis:

**Claim:** Animals with more complex
social systems evolve more complex
communication systems.

**Mechanism:** More complex social
relationships require more
differentiated signals to manage
them — more individuals to track,
more relationship types to signal,
more coalitions to negotiate.

**Prediction:** Social complexity
correlates with communication
complexity across species.

### 1.2 What The Research Actually Shows

The SCH is supported in some
comparative studies. It fails
in others. [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/11/3071) [[2]](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-018-2605-4.pdf)

**Counterexamples documented:**

**Forest vs. savanna elephants:**
Forest elephants have simpler social
structure than savanna elephants.
Vocal complexity does not drop
proportionally. Other pressures —
ecological (dense forest requiring
long-distance communication),
morphological (same vocal anatomy) —
maintain complexity independently
of social structure. [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/11/3071)

**Semi-solitary species with rich
communication:** Some species with
limited conspecific interaction
nonetheless develop elaborate
communication systems — driven by
sexual selection, predator-prey
dynamics, or ecological demands
rather than social complexity per se.

**Highly social species with limited
repertoires:** Some very social
animals manage complex group
dynamics with surprisingly limited
vocal repertoires — because the
primary communication channel is
not vocal (it is chemical, gestural,
or substrate-borne).

**The 2022 Royal Society review
concluded:** No simple relationship
exists among social, communicative,
and cognitive complexity. A more
multifactorial framework is required. [[3]](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rstb/article/377/1860/20210306/108985/Variation-in-communicative-complexity-in-relation)

### 1.3 Why The SCH Is Partially Wrong:
### The Framework Explanation

The SCH is measuring the wrong
variable.

Social complexity is a **proxy**
for the real predictor.

The real predictor is:

**Domain navigation depth.**

Formally:

```
Communication complexity =
  f(navigation depth in the
    bounded communication domain
    of this species)

Where navigation depth =
  ∫ [social pressure
   + ecological pressure
   + sexual selection pressure
   + morphological constraint
   + phylogenetic inheritance]
   × time dt
```

Social complexity is one term
in the integral.

It is not the whole integral.

**This is why the SCH partially
works and partially fails:**

When social complexity is the
dominant pressure term, SCH
predicts correctly.

When other pressure terms dominate
(ecological, sexual selection,
morphological), SCH fails.

The framework does not fail.

**Domain navigation depth across
all pressure axes predicts
communication complexity.**

Social complexity predicts it
only insofar as it is the dominant
pressure in that species' history.

### 1.4 The Replacement Predictor:
### Multi-Axis Navigation Depth

**The correct predictor for
communication complexity:**

```
NAVIGATION DEPTH SCORE (NDS)

NDS = (Social_complexity × Wsoc)
    + (Ecological_complexity × Weco)
    + (Sexual_selection_pressure × Wss)
    + (Morphological_freedom × Wmf)
    + (Phylogenetic_depth × Wpd)
    + (Temporal_duration × Wt)

Where W are weights specific
to the species' ecological niche
and evolutionary history.
```

**Species with high NDS across
multiple axes simultaneously
will have:**

- Rich communication domains
  with well-developed eigenfunction
  structure
- Multiple active channels
- High combinatorial complexity
  within channels
- High Tonnetz topology depth

**This predicts why sperm whales,
elephants, great apes, and corvids
are at the top of the gradient:**

They all have high NDS across
multiple axes simultaneously —
not just social, but ecological,
temporal depth, and morphological
flexibility all contributing.

## PART II: THE FIVE COMMUNICATION
## CHANNELS

### 2.1 The Channel Taxonomy

Animal communication operates
through five primary channels:

```
CHANNEL 1: ACOUSTIC
  Medium: Air or water
  Signal type: Pressure waves
  Propagation: Omnidirectional
    (mostly), range dependent
    on frequency and medium
  Eigenfunction structure: YES
    (bounded resonating anatomy)
  Cross-species tractability: HIGH

CHANNEL 2: VISUAL
  Medium: Light (photons)
  Signal type: Color, pattern,
    movement, shape, gesture,
    posture, facial expression
  Propagation: Line-of-sight,
    range dependent on light
    conditions
  Eigenfunction structure:
    PARTIAL (visual display
    spaces have stable attractors
    but the "bounding" is
    ecological and evolutionary,
    not anatomical in the same
    direct sense as acoustic)
  Cross-species tractability:
    MODERATE

CHANNEL 3: CHEMICAL
  Medium: Air, water, substrate
  Signal type: Volatile or
    non-volatile compounds
    (pheromones, kairomones,
    allomones, semiochemicals)
  Propagation: Diffusion-dependent,
    persistence variable
  Eigenfunction structure:
    COMPLEX — the "bounded domain"
    is the olfactory receptor space
    of the receiver, not a resonating
    anatomy of the sender
  Cross-species tractability: LOW
    to NONE for intraspecific
    pheromone channels;
    MODERATE for ecological
    chemical signals (alarm,
    predator cues)

CHANNEL 4: BEHAVIORAL/GESTURAL
  Medium: Space and time
    (physical movement)
  Signal type: Gesture, posture,
    touch, display, ritual
    movement sequence
  Propagation: Proximal (requires
    close range or visibility)
  Eigenfunction structure:
    YES — behavioral repertoires
    converge on stable attractor
    positions under social pressure
    (same eigenfunction logic as
    acoustic but in movement space
    rather than frequency space)
  Cross-species tractability:
    MODERATE to HIGH for species
    with overlapping motor
    repertoires

CHANNEL 5: SUBSTRATE-BORNE
  Medium: Ground, water surface,
    plant tissue, wood
  Signal type: Vibration,
    seismic wave, substrate
    pressure wave
  Propagation: Substrate-dependent,
    can exceed acoustic range
  Eigenfunction structure: YES
    (same physics as acoustic —
    bounded resonating system,
    different medium)
  Cross-species tractability:
    LOW currently (untapped
    research pathway — see
    elephant seismic findings)
```

### 2.2 Channel Properties Matrix

```
CHANNEL         EIGEN   XSPEC   PERSIST  RANGE   MODULATE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Acoustic        HIGH    HIGH    LOW       MED-HI  HIGH
Visual          MED     MED     LOW       MED     HIGH
Chemical        LOW*    LOW     HIGH      LOW-MED  LOW
Behavioral      MED-HI  MED-HI  LOW       LOW     HIGH
Substrate-borne HIGH    LOW**   LOW-MED   MED-HI  MED

EIGEN: Degree to which eigenfunction
  framework applies
XSPEC: Cross-species tractability
PERSIST: Signal persistence in
  environment after sender departs
RANGE: Communication range
MODULATE: Sender's ability to
  modulate signal in real-time

* Chemical eigenfunction structure
  exists in the olfactory receptor
  space but is receiver-internal,
  not sender-anatomy-determined
** Low currently — not because
  physics prevents it but because
  no research program has attempted
  seismic cross-species communication
```

## PART III: EIGENFUNCTION ANALYSIS
## OF EACH CHANNEL

### 3.1 Acoustic Channel
### (Already Established — Summary)

The bounded resonating anatomy
(vocal tract, spermaceti organ,
syrinx, etc.) produces eigenfunctions
determined by anatomy geometry.

Social + ecological + sexual
pressure drives navigation toward
eigenfunction positions.

Result: Tonnetz topology in the
acoustic space.

Cross-species tractability HIGH
because:
- Air and water transmit acoustic
  signals across species boundaries
- Receiver anatomy can physically
  detect sender signals even if
  not conspecific
- Eigenfunction positions in
  different species' anatomies
  are at different frequencies
  but same topology — topological
  translation possible

**This is the primary channel
for the current research program
and the most theoretically
developed.**

---

### 3.2 Visual Channel

**Does the visual channel have
eigenfunction structure?**

Yes — but the bounding is different.

In the acoustic channel, the
anatomy of the sender IS the
bounded resonating system.
The eigenfunctions are literally
in the sender's body.

In the visual channel, the
"bounded domain" is not anatomical
in the same direct sense.

It is **ecological and evolutionary:**

The visual display space is bounded
by:
- Perceptual range of conspecific
  receivers (what can be seen
  at relevant distances)
- Chromatic range of species-
  specific color vision
- Movement speed and precision
  limits of the body
- Environmental background
  constraints (what is visible
  against this habitat)

Under social + sexual selection
pressure, visual displays navigate
toward the stable attractors of
this bounded ecological-evolutionary
space.

**The result is still eigenfunction
convergence** — but driven by
ecological bounding rather than
anatomical bounding.

**Examples:**

Bird plumage colors converge on
the eigenfunction positions of
the local light environment filtered
through conspecific color vision
and sexual selection pressure.

Lizard head-bob displays converge
on stable temporal patterns
(frequency, amplitude, duration)
under territorial selection.

Great ape facial expressions
converge on stable configurations
under social selection — the
eigenfunction positions of the
face-movement space.

**Cross-species tractability:**

MODERATE rather than HIGH because:

The eigenfunction positions of the
visual display space are bounded
by the receiver's visual system —
which varies significantly across
species (color vision range,
motion detection sensitivity,
pattern recognition).

A signal at the eigenfunction
position of the sender's visual
display space may not land at
the eigenfunction position of
the receiver's visual perceptual
space if those spaces differ.

**However:**

For species with overlapping
visual systems (humans and great
apes share significant visual
system commonality), visual
channel cross-species tractability
is HIGH.

The hyperpolyglot's postural and
eye contact components worked
precisely because human and ape
visual systems overlap substantially.

**The gestural component of ape
communication (CS doc 1, Condition 2)
is a visual + behavioral channel
combination.**

Its tractability for human-ape
cross-species communication is
HIGH because of visual system
overlap.

---

### 3.3 Chemical Channel

**The most important channel
to analyze carefully because it
is the most commonly
misunderstood for cross-species
communication.**

**Does the chemical channel have
eigenfunction structure?**

Yes — but the structure is in
the receiver, not the sender.

**The olfactory receptor space
is a bounded domain:**

Mammals have ~400 functional
olfactory receptor genes (humans)
to ~1200 (dogs). Each receptor
responds to a specific chemical
structure.

The "eigenfunction positions" of
the chemical communication space
are the **receptor activation
patterns** that are maximally
discriminable and stable under
the receiver's olfactory system.

This is fundamentally different
from acoustic eigenfunctions:

Acoustic: bounded domain IS the
sender's anatomy. Any sender
whose anatomy resonates at those
frequencies produces the signal
at the eigenfunction position.

Chemical: bounded domain IS the
receiver's olfactory receptor
space. A sender must produce
a chemical that activates the
receiver's receptors in a
specific pattern to be "at the
eigenfunction position."

**This is why chemical communication
is primarily species-specific:**

Evolution has co-adapted sender
pheromone chemistry and receiver
receptor specificity within
species. The sender's chemical
is tuned to the receiver's
receptors.

Across species, the receptor
spaces differ. A chemical that
is at the eigenfunction position
of species A's olfactory space
is likely not at the eigenfunction
position of species B's olfactory
space.

**Exception: Ecological chemical
signals**

There is one category of chemical
signal that IS cross-species
tractable:

**Ecological semiochemicals** —
chemical signals associated with
ecological events:
- Predator scent
- Fire smoke
- Rotting matter
- Plant stress volatiles

These signals are cross-species
tractable because:
- Multiple species in the same
  ecosystem have independently
  evolved to respond to the same
  ecological chemical cues
- The "bounding" is ecological
  relevance rather than conspecific
  co-adaptation

**For the cross-species communication
program:**

Chemical channel: **NOT a primary
target for intentional cross-
species communication** because
the eigenfunction positions are
receiver-internal and species-specific.

But chemical channel is important
for **environmental context** —
the chemical background influences
the receiver's arousal state,
receptivity to novel signals,
and attribution model.

**A sender entering a species'
communication domain should be
aware of the chemical context
even if not attempting chemical
signaling.**

---

### 3.4 Behavioral/Gestural Channel

**The most undertheorized channel
in the current framework.**

The 2024 primate research shows:

Great apes use **nontrivial
compositionality** in gestural
combinations — one gesture
modifies the meaning of another. [[4]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10764-024-00416-8)

Gorillas show "regional accents"
in gestural communication —
different groups use different
stable configurations of the
same gesture repertoire. [[5]](https://noldus.com/blog/decoding-gorillas-gestures-insights-into-primate-communication)

Chimpanzees adjust gestural
communication based on whether
the receiver is attending —
meta-communication. [[6]](https://www.nature.com/research-intelligence/nri-topic-summaries/gestural-communication-and-language-evolution-in-great-apes-micro-11778)

**Does the behavioral/gestural
channel have eigenfunction structure?**

Yes.

The argument:

The body's motor system is a
bounded system with constraints:
- Biomechanical limits (joint
  range of motion, muscle
  attachment points)
- Neural motor control precision
- Energetic costs of different
  movements
- Perceptual detectability
  of movements at relevant
  social distances

Under social selection pressure,
behavioral/gestural communication
navigates toward the stable
attractors of this bounded
motor-perceptual space.

The eigenfunction positions of
the gestural space are the
**maximally discriminable,
energetically efficient, and
perceptually salient positions**
in the body-movement domain.

**"Regional accents" in gorilla
gestures are exactly what the
framework predicts:**

Different gorilla groups have
navigated different paths through
the same gestural eigenfunction
space — arriving at different
stable positions (different
dialect subgraphs of the same
Tonnetz).

**Cross-species tractability:**

HIGH for species with overlapping
motor repertoires and visual
systems.

Humans and great apes: HIGH —
shared primate body plan means
many gestural eigenfunction
positions overlap.

Humans and cetaceans: LOW —
radically different body plans,
minimal gestural overlap.

Humans and corvids: MODERATE —
different body plan but shared
air environment and overlapping
behavioral repertoires around
food, attention, and social
engagement.

**The gestural channel is the
primary channel for human-ape
cross-species communication
and should be treated as
co-primary with the acoustic
channel for that target species.**

---

### 3.5 Substrate-Borne Channel

**The most unexplored and
potentially highest-leverage
channel in the program.**

Elephant seismic communication
(CS doc 3) established that:
- Infrasound couples into
  Rayleigh waves at the ground
  surface
- Elephants receive through
  Pacinian corpuscles in feet
- Signal range exceeds airborne
  acoustic range

**But substrate-borne communication
is not limited to elephants:**

**Insects:** Many species communicate
via substrate vibration —
treehoppers, leafhoppers, stink
bugs, some beetles transmit
vibratory signals through plant
stems and leaves. The frequency
range is 10-1000 Hz. Combinatorial
structure exists. [[7]](https://myrmecologicalnews.org/cms/index.php?option=com_download&view=download&filename=volume36/mn36_25-28_printable.pdf&format=raw)

**Spiders:** Web-borne vibration
is a primary communication
channel — mate recognition,
prey detection, conspecific
signaling all through web
vibration. The web is a
bounded resonating system
with eigenfunctions determined
by web geometry.

**Fish:** Lateral line system
detects substrate-borne and
water-pressure vibrations as
a distinct channel from
hearing.

**Does the substrate-borne
channel have eigenfunction
structure?**

Yes — identical mathematics
to acoustic channel.

A substrate is a bounded medium.
Waves propagating through it
have eigenmodes determined by
the substrate geometry and
material properties.

The elephant rumble Rayleigh
wave is the same source anatomy
as the airborne acoustic signal —
the eigenfunction positions
should correspond physics-
predictably (the dual-medium
prediction from CS doc 3).

**Cross-species tractability:**

Currently LOW — not because
physics prevents it but because:

1. No research program has
   attempted it
2. Technology for precision
   substrate signal generation
   is not routinely deployed
   in field settings
3. The eigenfunction positions
   of the substrate channel
   have not been mapped for
   any target species

**But the potential is HIGH:**

For elephants specifically,
the substrate channel may offer
lower Condition 3 barriers than
the acoustic channel — because
elephant sender attribution
models already process signals
from physically unusual sources
(the ground).

---

## PART IV: THE COMMUNICATION
## BUNDLE CONCEPT

### 4.1 What A Communication Bundle Is

No species communicates through
a single channel.

Every species has a **communication
bundle** — a weighted combination
of channels that together
constitute its full communication
domain.

The bundle has:

**Primary channel:** The channel
carrying the most information,
used most frequently, most
developed eigenfunction structure.

**Secondary channels:** Channels
used in conjunction with the
primary, adding redundancy or
additional information dimensions.

**Contextual channels:** Channels
that set background state but
do not carry primary information
content.

**Emergency channels:** Channels
activated under specific
conditions (alarm, mating,
extended range requirements).

### 4.2 Bundle Profiles
### For Target Species

**Sperm Whales:**

```
Primary:    Acoustic (coda clicks)
Secondary:  Acoustic (broadband
              clicks for echolocation
              — also social)
Contextual: Hydrodynamic (body
              position, movement
              patterns)
Emergency:  Long-range infrasound
              (social contact)

Bundle character: ACOUSTIC-DOMINANT
Cross-species strategy: Acoustic
  channel sufficient for primary
  engagement
Condition 2 (multi-channel
  coherence): Acoustic coherence
  is primary requirement;
  hydrodynamic context secondary
```

**African Elephants:**

```
Primary:    Acoustic (infrasound
              rumbles, airborne)
Secondary:  Substrate-borne
              (seismic Rayleigh)
Secondary:  Visual (ear position,
              body orientation)
Contextual: Chemical (musth,
              individual scent)
Emergency:  Long-range seismic
              (beyond acoustic range)

Bundle character: ACOUSTIC +
  SUBSTRATE DUAL-MEDIUM DOMINANT
Cross-species strategy: Acoustic
  + seismic channels jointly
  required for full engagement
Condition 2: Acoustic-seismic
  coherence required;
  visual context important
```

**Bonobos:**

```
Primary:    Vocal (calls,
              combinatorial)
Primary:    Gestural (hands,
              face, body)
Secondary:  Facial expression
Secondary:  Postural
Contextual: Chemical (olfactory
              individual recognition)

Bundle character: VOCAL-GESTURAL
  CO-PRIMARY
Cross-species strategy: Vocal
  AND gestural channels must
  be coherent simultaneously
Condition 2: Vocal-gestural
  coherence is the primary
  multi-channel requirement
  — this is why the hyperpolyglot
  ape case worked (vocal +
  postural + eye contact all
  coherent)
```

**Ravens:**

```
Primary:    Acoustic (80+ call types)
Secondary:  Gestural (beak direction,
              wing position)
Secondary:  Gaze (eye direction —
              observer identity
              tracking is gaze-based)
Contextual: Behavioral sequence
              (approach, retreat,
              cache behavior)

Bundle character: ACOUSTIC-DOMINANT
  with gaze-gesture secondary
Cross-species strategy: Acoustic
  primary with gaze coherence
  secondary
Condition 2: Acoustic + gaze
  direction coherence
  — a sender who produces
  correct acoustic signals
  while maintaining gaze
  coherence is a stronger
  candidate for attribution
```

**Cleaner Wrasse (gradient
reference species):**

```
Primary:    Visual (color pattern,
              body movement)
Secondary:  Chemical (conspecific
              recognition)
Contextual: Behavioral sequence
              (cleaning dance)

Bundle character: VISUAL-PRIMARY
Cross-species note: Below Level 4
  gradient threshold — not a
  communication target but
  relevant for understanding
  visual channel structure
```

### 4.3 The Bundle Coherence
### Requirement

This is the precise formulation
of Condition 2 from CS document 1:

**Multi-channel coherence means
coherence within the target
species' communication bundle,
not arbitrary multi-channel
output.**

A sender producing signals in
all five channels simultaneously
but not coherently is worse than
a sender producing signals in
the primary channel only.

Incoherence across channels
within the bundle produces
a worse incoherence spike than
channel absence — because the
receiver's attribution model
detects contradictory signals
from what should be a unified
sender.

**The bundle coherence requirement:**

```
For successful cross-species
communication:

All active channels in the
target species' communication
bundle must be:

1. Present (not absent)
2. At eigenfunction positions
   (not random)
3. Coherent with each other
   (not contradictory across
   channels)
4. Forming a unified trajectory
   through the joint bundle
   eigenfunction space
   (not independent signals
   in each channel separately)
```

**This is why the hyperpolyglot
ape case produced a spike rather
than communication:**

He achieved bundle coherence
in vocal + postural + eye contact.

But the bundle's Condition 3
(sender attribution) could not
close because the sender profile
(human body, human face) was
not in the ape's attribution
model for ape-coherent signals.

The bundle coherence was achieved.
The attribution was not.

**Both are required.**

## PART V: CHANNEL TRACTABILITY
## HIERARCHY FOR CROSS-SPECIES
## COMMUNICATION

### 5.1 The Hierarchy

Ranked by tractability for a
human sender attempting to enter
a target species' communication
domain:

**TIER 1 — Highest tractability:**

```
ACOUSTIC CHANNEL

Why:
- Physical propagation through
  shared medium (air or water)
- Human anatomy can produce
  signals in target frequency
  ranges with technology
- Eigenfunction framework fully
  developed (Tonnetz topology)
- Target species can physically
  receive human-produced signals
- Topological translation possible:
  produce signals at topologically
  equivalent positions in target
  species' Tonnetz without
  matching absolute frequency

Limitation:
- Does not work for purely
  substrate-borne species
- Underwater: requires hydrophone
  technology for cetaceans
```

**TIER 2 — High tractability
with constraints:**

```
BEHAVIORAL/GESTURAL CHANNEL

Why high:
- Shared primate body plan with
  great apes gives substantial
  gestural eigenfunction overlap
- Human body can produce
  signals in target gestural
  space without technology
- Nontrivial compositionality
  in ape gestures confirmed —
  rich combinatorial structure
  to engage with

Why constrained:
- Requires visual line-of-sight
- Proximal range only
- Does not transfer to cetaceans
  or most non-primate species
- Body plan differences reduce
  eigenfunction overlap for
  non-primate targets

Tier 2 applies to: Great apes,
  possibly corvids for limited
  gestural elements
```

**TIER 3 — Moderate tractability:**

```
VISUAL CHANNEL

Why moderate:
- Humans can produce visual
  signals (color, pattern,
  movement) perceivable by
  target species
- Ecological visual signals
  (attention direction, body
  orientation) cross species
  boundaries readily

Why constrained:
- Visual systems vary enormously
  across taxa (color vision range,
  UV sensitivity, motion detection)
- Signals designed for human
  visual system may not land at
  eigenfunction positions in
  target species' visual space
- Requires overlap in visual
  system properties for
  tractability

Tier 3 applies to: Diurnal
  vertebrates with visual
  system overlap with humans;
  corvids (excellent vision,
  high motion detection)
```

**TIER 4 — Low tractability
currently, high potential:**

```
SUBSTRATE-BORNE CHANNEL

Why low currently:
- No established research
  methodology for cross-species
  substrate signaling
- Technology for precision
  substrate signal generation
  in field settings underdeveloped
- Eigenfunction mapping of
  substrate channel for target
  species not yet done

Why high potential:
- Elephant seismic finding opens
  clear pathway
- Physics identical to acoustic
  (same eigenfunction mathematics,
  different medium)
- May offer lower Condition 3
  barriers for species like
  elephants that already process
  substrate signals as communication
- Untapped: no other research
  program is targeting this

Tier 4 now, potentially Tier 1
  after eigenfunction mapping
  and technology development
```

**TIER 5 — Not a primary target:**

```
CHEMICAL CHANNEL

Why:
- Eigenfunction structure is
  receiver-internal and species-
  specific (olfactory receptor
  co-adaptation)
- Cross-species chemical signal
  production requires knowledge
  of target species' receptor
  space — essentially impossible
  without synthetic chemistry
  laboratory capability in the
  field
- Even with correct chemistry,
  chemical signals cannot be
  modulated in real-time for
  conversational communication

Partial exception:
- Ecological semiochemicals
  (predator scent, alarm cues)
  cross species boundaries
- Can be used for environmental
  context management: removing
  human scent (reducing predator
  cue presence), introducing
  neutral or familiar scents
- Not a communication channel
  but an attribution context
  channel: manage the chemical
  background to reduce Condition 3
  barriers
```

## PART VI: THE SOCIAL COMPLEXITY
## HYPOTHESIS RECONSIDERED IN
## FULL FRAMEWORK

### 6.1 The Framework Replacement
### of the SCH

The SCH asks: does social complexity
predict communication complexity?

The framework asks: does navigation
depth across all pressure axes
predict communication complexity?

The framework answer is more
precise and more predictive.

**But the SCH is not useless.**

It is a **first-order approximation**
of the multi-axis navigation depth
score for species where social
pressure is the dominant pressure
term.

For great apes, elephants, cetaceans,
corvids — social pressure IS
dominant. SCH works for them.

For forest elephants vs. savanna
elephants — ecological pressure
overrides social pressure
differences. SCH fails.

For sexually-selected species with
limited social structure — sexual
selection pressure dominates. SCH
fails in a predictable way.

**The framework tells you when
to trust SCH and when not to.**

Trust SCH when: social pressure
is clearly the dominant term
in the navigation depth integral.

Do not trust SCH when: ecological,
sexual selection, or morphological
pressures are clearly competing
with or overriding social pressure.

### 6.2 The Critical Distinction:
### Social Complexity vs.
### Communication Complexity

The SCH conflates two things
that should be separated:

**Social complexity** — how
complex are the social relationships?
Number of individuals, relationship
differentiation, coalition structure,
dominance hierarchy, cultural
transmission.

**Communication complexity** —
how complex is the communication
system? Repertoire size, combinatorial
depth, Tonnetz topology richness,
multi-channel integration.

These are related but not identical.

**The framework adds a third
variable that mediates between
them:**

**Channel selection** — which
channels does the species primarily
use, and how does the eigenfunction
structure of those channels
constrain what kinds of complexity
are possible?

```
Social complexity
  ↓
(Navigation depth in communication
  domain, mediated by channel
  selection)
  ↓
Communication complexity
  (in the dominant channel(s))
```

A species with high social
complexity that primarily uses
chemical channels will develop
high chemical communication
complexity — but this does not
show up in vocal repertoire
studies.

This is why some highly social
species appear to have "simple"
communication when measured
vocally: the complexity is in
the chemical channel, which
vocal-focused studies miss.

**Multi-channel communication
complexity is the right dependent
variable.**

Not vocal complexity.
Not gestural complexity.
**Bundle complexity.**

### 6.3 Implications for Target
### Species Selection

The framework prediction:

**High-value cross-species
communication targets have:**

1. High navigation depth score
   (NDS) across multiple axes

2. A communication bundle with
   at least one Tier 1 or Tier 2
   tractable channel as primary
   or co-primary

3. Level 4-5 on the triadic
   gradient (confirmed theory
   of mind)

4. Bundle eigenfunction structure
   that is formally mappable
   with current technology

This excludes:
- Highly social species whose
  primary channel is chemical
  (ants, bees, many rodents) —
  tractability too low
- Species with high NDS but
  below Level 4 gradient —
  theory of mind absent

This confirms:
- Sperm whales: acoustic-dominant
  bundle, Level 5, highest
  eigenfunction mapping progress
- Elephants: acoustic+seismic
  bundle, Level 5, dual-medium
  prediction untested but tractable
- Bonobos: vocal-gestural
  co-primary bundle, Level 5
  confirmed, attribution bridge
  pathway clear
- Ravens: acoustic-dominant
  with gaze secondary, Level 5,
  bundle tractable
- Orcas: acoustic-dominant,
  Level 5 evidence, bundle
  tractable but eigenfunction
  mapping less advanced

## PART VII: THE COMPLETE
## CROSS-SPECIES COMMUNICATION
## ARCHITECTURE

### 7.1 The Full Architecture

Cross-species communication
is not a single problem.

It is a nested architecture
of problems that must be solved
in sequence:

```
LAYER 1: SPECIES CANDIDACY
  Is the target species at Level 4-5
  on the triadic gradient?
  Does it have confirmed theory
  of mind?
  → Triadic gradient instrument
    (mirror test + behavioral ToM)

LAYER 2: BUNDLE MAPPING
  What is the target species'
  communication bundle?
  What are the primary and secondary
  channels?
  What is the channel weighting?
  → Multi-channel observation and
    analysis

LAYER 3: EIGENFUNCTION MAPPING
  For each bundle channel, what
  are the eigenfunction positions?
  What is the Tonnetz topology?
  → Spectral analysis (acoustic),
    behavioral repertoire analysis
    (gestural), display analysis
    (visual), TDA for topology

LAYER 4: BUNDLE TRACTABILITY
  Which channels in the bundle
  are Tier 1-3 tractable?
  Can the human sender produce
  signals in those channels
  at eigenfunction positions?
  → Channel tractability hierarchy
    applied to specific bundle

LAYER 5: CONDITION 3 PATHWAY
  What properties must the sender
  have for the receiver's
  third-order triad to incorporate
  them as a coherent gap navigator?
  → Attribution bridge methodology:
    temporal exposure, acoustic
    identity, bundle coherence

LAYER 6: COMMUNICATION EVENT
  Design a specific signal sequence
  that:
  - Occupies eigenfunction positions
    in all tractable bundle channels
  - Achieves bundle coherence
  - Forms a Tonnetz trajectory
    (not just positions)
  - Comes from a sender capable
    of attribution loop closure
  → Full cross-species communication
    event design
```

### 7.2 The Scope Reality

**What vocal topology gives us:**

Vocal topology — the Tonnetz
framework applied to the acoustic
channel — gives us:

- Precise geometric map of the
  acoustic component of the
  communication bundle
- Testable predictions about
  which acoustic signals will
  be recognized as domain-coherent
- A generative grammar for
  acoustic Tonnetz trajectories
- The most developed theoretical
  and empirical foundation in
  the program

**What vocal topology does not
give us:**

The complete communication bundle.

For every target species except
sperm whales (acoustic-dominant),
the acoustic channel is one of
multiple primary channels.

**For bonobos:** Vocal topology
gives us one input to a
vocal-gestural co-primary bundle.
We also need gestural eigenfunction
mapping.

**For elephants:** Vocal topology
gives us the airborne acoustic
component. We also need seismic
eigenfunction mapping and the
dual-medium correspondence test.

**For ravens:** Vocal topology
gives us the primary channel
but gaze coherence is load-bearing
for Condition 3.

**For orcas:** Vocal topology
gives us the primary channel
but pod dialect differences
require clan-specific Tonnetz
mapping.

**The scope conclusion:**

```
Vocal topology is a necessary
but not sufficient component
of the cross-species communication
program for most target species.

It is sufficient alone for:
  Sperm whales (acoustic-dominant
  bundle)

It is necessary but requires
gestural addition for:
  Bonobos, chimpanzees,
  other great apes

It is necessary but requires
seismic addition for:
  Elephants

It is necessary but requires
gaze coherence addition for:
  Ravens and corvids

It is necessary but requires
full underwater bundle mapping
for:
  Dolphins, orcas
```

## PART VIII: THE IMPORTANT
## DISTINCTIONS

### 8.1 Communication vs.
### Information Transfer

A critical distinction the
literature sometimes blurs:

**Information transfer** —
signals that change the receiver's
state without the receiver
modeling the sender as a
gap navigator.

Alarm calls across species.
Predator odors. Environmental cues.

These are information transfer.
Not communication.

**Communication** — signals
where the receiver models
the sender as a gap navigator
with internal states, and the
meaning of the signal is
attributed to those internal states.

This requires the third-order
triad.

**The framework targets communication,
not information transfer.**

Information transfer across species
is common and extensively documented.

Communication across species —
where the receiver models the
sender as a gap navigator —
is rare, possibly unprecedented
outside of human-domesticated
animal relationships.

**The cross-species communication
program is attempting something
that may not have occurred
in the history of life.**

Not signal transfer across
species boundaries — that happens
constantly.

**Intentional gap-navigator-to-
gap-navigator exchange across
the species boundary.**

That is the target.

### 8.2 Reception vs. Production

A second critical distinction:

**Reception** — the target species
receiving and attributing signals
from a novel sender.

**Production** — the human sender
producing signals in the target
species' communication bundle.

The research program has focused
primarily on reception — getting
the whale/ape/elephant to recognize
and attribute the sender's signals.

But production is equally important
and has different constraints:

**Acoustic production:**
Human vocal anatomy can produce
signals in some target frequency
ranges. For cetaceans (high
frequency) and elephants
(infrasound below human range),
technology is required.

**Gestural production:**
Human motor system can produce
signals in great ape gestural
space — body plan overlap is
sufficient.

**Substrate production:**
Technology required for seismic
signal generation. But technically
straightforward with available
equipment.

**Visual production:**
Human body can produce visual
signals perceivable by most
vertebrate targets.

**The production constraint
assessment:**

```
Sperm whales:    Technology required
                   (hydrophone system)
Elephants:       Technology required
                   for infrasound and
                   seismic channels
Bonobos:         No technology required
                   for primary bundle —
                   human body sufficient
                   for vocal-gestural
Ravens:          No technology required
                   — human vocal range
                   overlaps with crow
                   acoustic range;
                   gestural overlap high
Orcas:           Technology required
                   (underwater acoustic)
```

### 8.3 The Domestication Shortcut

One pathway the framework has
not yet adequately addressed:

**Co-evolutionary adaptation
as a substitute for theory of
mind in Condition 3.**

Dogs have not been formally
assessed as Level 4 on the
gradient. Yet humans and dogs
communicate in a functionally
rich way.

The reason: 15,000 years of
co-evolutionary pressure has
built human-specific response
patterns into the dog's
sender attribution model.

The dog has not developed full
theory of mind toward humans.

It has developed a **specialized
attribution module** for human-
specific signals — one that
functions like attribution
without requiring the full
third-order triad.

**The domestication shortcut:**

Sustained multi-generational
exposure to a specific sender
type builds specialized attribution
modules even in the absence of
full theory of mind.

**For the cross-species communication
program:**

This suggests a second pathway
to Condition 3 closure beyond
full theory of mind:

**Extended individual exposure**
(not multi-generational, but
sustained individual interaction
over months-years) may build
a partial attribution module
for the novel sender in a
species that already has Level 4+
theory of mind.

If a Level 5 species can build
full attribution through temporal
exposure —

And a dog-level species can
build specialized attribution
through evolutionary exposure —

Then the question becomes:

**Can a Level 4-5 species build
functional attribution toward
a novel sender in the timescale
of individual experience rather
than evolution?**

The bonobo absent-agent acoustic
modeling finding suggests: yes.

The bonobo maintains mental models
of absent agents through acoustic
identity alone. If a novel acoustic
agent maintains consistent identity
over multiple encounters, the
bonobo's attribution model may
incorporate it within the timescale
of individual experience.

**This is the near-term Condition 3
pathway for the bonobo target.**

## PART IX: OPEN QUESTIONS

```
Q1: BUNDLE DOMINANCE MEASUREMENT
  How do we formally measure
  channel weighting in a
  communication bundle?
  What methodology determines
  whether a species is acoustic-
  dominant vs. vocal-gestural
  co-primary?
  Is it information content per
  channel? Frequency of use?
  Behavioral response strength?

Q2: GESTURAL EIGENFUNCTION MAPPING
  Can the same TDA methodology
  applied to acoustic coda data
  be applied to gestural
  repertoire data?
  What is the "signal" for TDA
  in the gestural space?
  (Movement trajectories?
  Kinematic parameters?
  Temporal sequences of gesture
  types?)

Q3: CHEMICAL BACKGROUND MANAGEMENT
  What is the optimal chemical
  background for cross-species
  communication attempts?
  How does predator scent
  presence/absence affect
  receiver arousal and
  attribution model receptivity?
  Can scent-neutral human presence
  be achieved in field conditions?

Q4: BUNDLE COHERENCE MEASUREMENT
  How do we measure whether a
  sender is achieving bundle
  coherence vs. channel-by-channel
  coherence?
  Is there a behavioral indicator
  of bundle coherence vs. partial
  coherence in the receiver?

Q5: DOMESTICATION SHORTCUT TIMELINE
  In a Level 5 species with
  confirmed theory of mind,
  how many consistent encounters
  with a novel sender producing
  bundle-coherent signals are
  required for Condition 3 closure?
  Is the learning curve linear,
  sigmoidal, or threshold?

Q6: PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY
  What is the minimum viable
  technology for producing:
  a) Infrasound at elephant
     eigenfunction positions
     in field conditions?
  b) Spermaceti-Tonnetz-coherent
     signals via hydrophone?
  c) Seismic signals at elephant
     substrate channel eigenfunction
     positions?

Q7: SCH WEIGHT ESTIMATION
  Can the multi-axis navigation
  depth score (NDS) be formalized
  with empirically estimated
  weights for different species?
  Can we build a comparative
  table of NDS across candidate
  species to rank them more
  precisely than the current
  qualitative gradient?
```

## PART X: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

### 10.1 The Core Findings
### of This Document

```
1. The Social Complexity Hypothesis
   is a first-order approximation
   of a more precise predictor:
   multi-axis navigation depth.
   It works when social pressure
   dominates. It fails when other
   pressures dominate. The framework
   explains both its successes
   and failures.

2. Animal communication operates
   through five primary channels:
   acoustic, visual, chemical,
   behavioral/gestural, and
   substrate-borne. Each has
   different eigenfunction structure
   and different cross-species
   tractability.

3. Chemical channel is not a
   primary target for cross-species
   communication. Its eigenfunction
   structure is receiver-internal
   and species-specific. It is
   relevant as attribution context
   management, not as a signal
   channel.

4. Every species has a communication
   bundle — a weighted combination
   of channels. Cross-species
   communication requires entering
   the bundle, not just one channel.

5. Vocal topology (Tonnetz framework)
   is the most theoretically
   developed and tractable channel
   in the program. It is necessary
   but not sufficient for most
   target species.

6. Sperm whales are the only Tier 1
   target for which acoustic channel
   alone may be sufficient (acoustic-
   dominant bundle).

7. Bonobos require vocal-gestural
   bundle coherence. The gestural
   channel needs the same eigenfunction
   mapping methodology applied to
   it as the acoustic channel.

8. Elephants require acoustic +
   seismic bundle coherence. The
   seismic channel is the highest-
   leverage unexplored pathway
   in the entire program.

9. Information transfer across
   species is common. Communication
   — where the receiver models
   the sender as a gap navigator —
   is the target and is potentially
   unprecedented in the history
   of life outside of human-
   domesticated animal relationships.

10. The domestication shortcut
    suggests that sustained individual
    exposure with a Level 5 species
    may build functional attribution
    within the timescale of individual
    experience rather than evolution.
    This is the primary near-term
    Condition 3 pathway.
```

### 10.2 The Single Most Important
### Sentence

```
Vocal topology is the entry point.

The communication bundle is the
destination.

They are not the same thing.

Knowing the eigenfunction positions
of the acoustic channel tells you
where to knock.

It does not tell you how to open
the door.

Opening the door requires bundle
coherence — all active channels,
simultaneously, at eigenfunction
positions, forming a unified
trajectory that the receiver's
third-order triad can model
as coming from a gap navigator.

That is the full scope of the
program.

Vocal topology gets you to the
door.

The rest of the program gets
you through it.
