## PREAMBLE: THE QUESTION BEING
## ASKED

CS doc 6 established:

1. The standard visual MSR test
   measures mirror-learning speed,
   not self-model presence.

2. The reversed protocol separates
   them: self-model primed → mirror
   recognized as tool within minutes.

3. The wrasse demonstrates RARFL
   running visibly in an olfactory-
   adjacent self-inspection niche.

4. The Self-Awareness Homology
   Hypothesis suggests self-awareness
   is conserved from a 450-million-
   year vertebrate ancestor —
   not independently invented
   in each lineage.

The question this document asks:

**If the standard visual MSR test
has been measuring the wrong thing
for olfactory-dominant species,
what does the evidence actually
look like when those species are
tested in their primary modality?**

And the further question:

**Is this pattern converging across
independent evolutionary lineages —
or is it a single finding specific
to dogs?**

## PART I: THE OLFACTORY
## SELF-MODEL — WHAT IT IS

### 1.1 Defining the Olfactory
### Self-Model

From the broader framework:

A **self-model** is the internal
representation an organism
maintains of its own body state —
its boundaries, condition, identity
markers, and deviation from
expected state.

For visual-dominant species:
the self-model is primarily
maintained in visual space.
The mirror provides external
access to the visual self-model.

For olfactory-dominant species:
the self-model is primarily
maintained in **chemical space.**

The chemical self-model is:

```
OLFACTORY SELF-MODEL:
  A continuously maintained
  internal representation of
  own chemical identity —
  the baseline scent profile
  of this body — against which
  deviations (novel elements,
  alterations, additions) are
  detectable as anomalies.

Components:
  - Species-level scent signature
    (shared with conspecifics)
  - Individual-level scent
    signature (unique to this body)
  - State-dependent variation
    (health, reproductive status,
    stress, diet — all encoded
    in chemical profile)
  - Spatial signature
    (where I have been, deposited
    in environmental marks)

The gap-detection operation
on the olfactory self-model:

  EXPECTED STATE:
    "My scent is X"
  
  DETECTED STATE:
    "This sample that is otherwise
    mine has an additional element Y"
  
  GAP:
    "Something has been added to
    my scent. This is anomalous.
    I should investigate."
  
  RARFL:
    Investigate the anomaly.
    Evaluate what Y is.
    Update model.
    Navigate gap.
```

This is the exact structure
Horowitz tested in dogs.
Cazzolla Gatti tested in wolves.
Freiburger tested in snakes.

In each case, the experimental
probe was:

**Take the animal's own scent.
Add a novel element.
Present it back.
Observe whether the animal
notices the anomaly.**

The anomaly is only noticeable
if the animal has a stable
baseline representation of
its own scent — an olfactory
self-model — against which
the alteration registers as a gap.

**If the animal investigates the
altered-own-scent more than the
unaltered-own-scent:**

Gap detected.

RARFL triggered.

Olfactory self-model confirmed
as operational.

## PART II: THE FIVE SPECIES CASES

### CASE 1: DOG
### (Canis lupus familiaris)

```
EVOLUTIONARY POSITION:
  Canid. Domestic subspecies
  of grey wolf. ~15,000 years
  of co-evolution with humans.
  
SENSORY DOMINANCE:
  Olfactory. The dog nose
  contains ~300 million
  olfactory receptors (human:
  ~6 million). Brain olfactory
  bulb is proportionally
  ~40× larger relative to
  brain size than humans.
  
  Primary world-model is
  chemical, not visual.
  
VISUAL MSR RESULT:
  Inconsistent. Majority of
  studies: dogs do not pass
  standard visual MSR.
  They do not investigate
  facial marks in the mirror.
  
  This is not surprising.
  A dog checking a mirror
  for facial marks is using
  its weakest sense to inspect
  its least chemically salient
  body surface.
  
OLFACTORY STSR RESULT:
  POSITIVE (Horowitz 2017).
  
  Dogs investigate own urine
  altered with novel scent
  significantly more than
  unaltered own urine.
  
  They recognize the anomaly.
  They recognize that their
  own scent has been changed.
  
  The olfactory self-model
  is operational.

ECOLOGICAL NICHE ANALYSIS:
  Social pack animal.
  Territory marked by urine
  and gland secretions.
  Individual identity
  communicated and read via
  chemical signatures.
  Own scent condition is
  directly relevant to:
  - Social standing
  - Reproductive signaling
  - Territory ownership
  
  The olfactory self-model
  in dogs is the primary
  social identity infrastructure.
  
  Of course it is maintained
  and monitored.
  Of course deviations are noticed.
  
NAVIGATION DEPTH ASSESSMENT:
  Deep navigation in olfactory
  self-model domain.
  Tens of thousands of years
  of social pressure maintaining
  and refining the chemical
  identity system.

GRADIENT POSITION:
  Previously: Stage 0-1 on
  visual MSR gradient.
  Revised: Stage 1-2 on
  olfactory self-model gradient.
  The self-model is present
  and operational in the
  primary modality.
```

---

### CASE 2: GREY WOLF
### (Canis lupus)

```
EVOLUTIONARY POSITION:
  Canid. Direct ancestor
  of domestic dogs. Wild.
  ~1 million years in
  current form.
  
SENSORY DOMINANCE:
  Olfactory. Same architecture
  as dogs. Pack animal with
  territory maintained by
  scent marking.
  
VISUAL MSR RESULT:
  Not formally studied.
  Wolves in captivity do not
  react aggressively to mirrors —
  they do not treat the reflection
  as a rival — which suggests
  some level of contingency
  detection ("that moves when I
  move") but no formal MSR
  positive confirmed.
  
OLFACTORY STSR RESULT:
  POSITIVE (Cazzolla Gatti et al.
  2021).
  
  Four captive wolves at Wolf Park,
  Indiana. Presented with:
  - Own urine (unaltered)
  - Own urine + novel scent (anise)
  - Unfamiliar dog urine
  - Other wolves' urine
  
  Wolves spent significantly more
  time investigating own urine
  altered with novel scent
  than unaltered own urine.
  
  They recognized the anomaly
  in their own chemical signature.
  
  Olfactory self-model operational.

CRITICAL COMPARISON WITH DOGS:
  Wolves and dogs show the same
  STSR result despite:
  - Different levels of
    socialization with humans
  - Different domestication status
  - Different social environments
    (pack-living wild vs.
    human-household domestic)
  
  The olfactory self-model is
  not a domestication artifact.
  It is present in the wild
  canid ancestor.
  
  Domestication did not create
  canid olfactory self-awareness.
  Domestication merely changed
  the context in which it operates.

ECOLOGICAL NICHE ANALYSIS:
  Wolf territory maintenance
  via scent marking is fundamental
  to pack survival —
  territory defense, resource
  control, inter-pack boundary
  communication.
  
  Individual wolf scent identity
  within the pack establishes
  rank, reproductive status,
  current health state.
  
  The olfactory self-model
  is operational social infrastructure
  in wild wolves.
  
  Its presence in dogs is
  inherited from wolves.
  It was not selected into
  dogs by humans.
  It was already there.

GRADIENT POSITION:
  Same as dogs: Stage 1-2
  on olfactory self-model
  gradient.
  Pre-dates domestication.
```

---

### CASE 3: BEAR
### (Ursus arctos, Ursus americanus)

```
EVOLUTIONARY POSITION:
  Ursidae. Diverged from
  canids ~38 million years
  ago. Related to canids
  at deeper evolutionary
  level — both are Carnivora.
  
SENSORY DOMINANCE:
  Olfactory. Bears have
  the most acute sense of
  smell of any land animal
  studied — olfactory bulb
  five times the absolute
  size of humans.
  Can detect scent ~20 miles
  away under favorable conditions.
  Primary world-model is
  chemical.
  
VISUAL MSR RESULT:
  NOT PASSED formally.
  
  BUT: Black bears at mirrors
  show a distinctive response —
  they remain calm, do not
  threaten the reflection
  (unlike species that treat
  their reflection as a rival),
  and sometimes investigate
  behind or around the mirror.
  
  This is the "knows it is not
  a real bear" response, not
  the "knows it is me" response.
  
  It suggests contingency
  detection ("that entity follows
  my movements and does not
  have independent smell cues
  — it is not a real bear")
  without full self-attribution.
  
  HYPOTHESIS: Bears may have
  already processed "not a real
  bear" via olfactory means
  before visual inspection
  completes — the absence of
  conspecific scent emanating
  from the mirror resolves
  the identity question
  before visual self-recognition
  has time to develop.
  
  The bear's primary test
  is olfactory. The mirror
  fails the olfactory test
  immediately (no smell).
  The visual component is
  already secondary by the
  time the bear looks.

OLFACTORY SELF-MODEL EVIDENCE:
  Not formally tested via STSR.
  
  BUT: Strong indirect evidence:
  
  1. Individual VOC signatures:
     Brown bear skin-borne
     secretions show individual-
     level variation in volatile
     organic compound profiles.
     Other bears can identify
     individuals via scent.
     
  2. Rub tree behavior:
     Bears rub extensively
     against specific trees —
     depositing their own scent
     while also reading scent
     left by other bears.
     This is simultaneous
     self-broadcast and other-
     reading.
     
     A bear rubbing its own
     chemical signature onto
     a tree is externalizing
     a self-model into the
     environment.
     
     It knows what it smells like.
     It is deliberately depositing
     that signature.
     
  3. Scent-matching behavior:
     Bears revisit their own
     rub trees and investigate
     whether other bears have
     also rubbed them.
     They can distinguish
     their own prior marking
     from new additions.
     
     This is the STSR logic
     in environmental form:
     own scent + novel scent
     detected as modified.

CRITICAL FINDING — BEARS AS
SOLITARY ANIMALS WITH
OLFACTORY INTELLIGENCE:
  
  Bears are largely solitary.
  
  The Social Complexity Hypothesis
  predicts their communication
  system would be simpler
  than social species.
  
  BUT: bears have one of the
  most sophisticated olfactory
  systems in mammals.
  
  Why?
  
  Not social complexity.
  
  ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY:
  
  Bears survive by tracking:
  - Food sources (fruiting
    timing, berry patches,
    fish runs, carrion)
  - Territory and competitor
    presence
  - Reproductive partner
    availability across vast
    ranges
  - Own health and condition
    (relevant for hibernation
    preparation)
  
  The olfactory world-model
  of a bear is not primarily
  a social model.
  
  It is an ecological map —
  a chemical representation
  of the landscape and its
  temporal dynamics.
  
  The bear's own scent is
  one of the most important
  data points in that map.
  
  Where has this bear been?
  What is this bear's
  current condition?
  How long ago was this
  bear here?
  
  All readable from the bear's
  own deposited signature.
  
  The bear needs to know
  its own signature in order
  to maintain and broadcast it.
  
  This is the olfactory self-model
  serving an ecological rather
  than social function.
  
  This is exactly what CS doc 4
  predicted would happen when
  ecological pressure is the
  dominant term in the
  Navigation Depth Score.

PREDICTED STSR RESULT:
  POSITIVE.
  
  If the STSR were performed
  on bears with altered own-
  scent samples, the prediction
  from the framework is
  that bears would investigate
  the altered sample more
  than the unaltered — possibly
  at higher response intensity
  than wolves or dogs, because
  the olfactory self-model
  is more ecologically
  central in bears.
  
  This is a testable prediction.
  It has not yet been tested.

GRADIENT POSITION:
  Currently: not formally
  assessed on olfactory gradient.
  
  Predicted: Stage 1-2, possibly
  Stage 2 on olfactory gradient
  (operational self-model,
  RARFL triggered by own-scent
  modification, ecological
  complexity driving deep
  navigation of olfactory
  self-model domain).
```

### CASE 4: WHITE-TAILED DEER
### (Odocoileus virginianus)

```
EVOLUTIONARY POSITION:
  Cervidae (deer family).
  Artiodactyla. Diverged
  from the bear-canid lineage
  much earlier — Carnivora
  and Artiodactyla split
  ~80 million years ago.
  
  This is the critical case
  for the convergence argument.
  
  Dogs and wolves are closely
  related. Bears are related
  to dogs at the Carnivora
  level. Deer are in a
  completely separate
  mammalian order.
  
  If deer show the same
  olfactory self-model pattern
  as Carnivora, this is
  CONVERGENT evolution —
  OR it is the homologous
  trait expressed under
  similar selective pressure
  in a distant lineage.
  
SENSORY DOMINANCE:
  Olfactory. Deer have an
  estimated 297 million
  olfactory receptors vs.
  ~6 million in humans.
  
  Primary world-model: chemical.
  
  Vision is important but
  primarily used for motion
  detection and predator
  avoidance. The deer's
  detailed world-knowledge
  is chemical.
  
THE SCENT GLAND SYSTEM:
  White-tailed deer possess
  SEVEN dedicated scent gland
  systems, each encoding
  different information:
  
  1. PREORBITAL GLANDS
     (near eyes):
     Used at licking branches
     above scrapes.
     Encodes identity, possibly
     emotional/social state.
     Deer rub preorbital glands
     on branches — depositing
     a signature from a
     self-accessible body region.
     
  2. TARSAL GLANDS
     (inside hind legs):
     The most information-dense
     system.
     Used in rub-urination:
     urine is deliberately
     channeled over the tarsal
     gland tuft during urination.
     The resulting mixed signal
     is unique to the individual
     and encodes reproductive
     status, dominance, and
     individual identity.
     
     CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
     Rub-urination is an active
     composition behavior.
     The deer is not passively
     depositing scent.
     It is COMPOSING a signal —
     blending two elements (urine
     + tarsal gland secretion)
     to create a specific
     chemical identity statement.
     
     To compose this signal,
     the deer must have an
     operational internal model
     of what the composed
     signal should be — what
     "this deer's tarsal
     signature" is.
     
     This is olfactory self-model
     in active use as a
     composition tool.
     
  3. METATARSAL GLANDS
     (outside hind legs):
     Function debated.
     Possible alarm signal.
     Vestigial in some subspecies.
     
  4. INTERDIGITAL GLANDS
     (between hooves):
     Deposit trail signature
     with every step.
     Enable individual tracking
     and herd cohesion.
     
     A deer walking is
     continuously broadcasting
     its identity through space.
     Its feet are the antenna.
     
  5. FOREHEAD GLANDS:
     Active in bucks during rut.
     Rubbed on branches above
     scrapes.
     Part of multi-layer
     scrape communication
     (interdigital + tarsal
     + preorbital + forehead
     all deposited at scrape
     sites).
     
  6. NASAL GLANDS:
     Contribute to breath
     scent and nostril secretion.
     
  7. PREPUTIAL GLANDS
     (males):
     Contribute to rutting scent.
  
  THIS IS THE MOST ELABORATE
  SCENT-IDENTITY SYSTEM IN
  ANY LAND MAMMAL STUDIED.
  
  The deer is not just
  olfactory-dominant.
  
  It is olfactory-specialized
  for SELF-BROADCAST at
  every scale and context:
  - Spatial (interdigital trail)
  - Identity (tarsal + preorbital)
  - State (forehead rut glands)
  - Composite (rub-urination)
  
  A deer moving through a
  landscape is writing its
  olfactory autobiography
  on everything it touches.
  
VISUAL MSR RESULT:
  Not formally studied.
  
  Deer would almost certainly
  not pass the standard visual
  MSR test.
  
  Reasons:
  - Flight-prey animal.
    Mirrors produce unfamiliar
    visual stimuli.
    Likely flight response,
    not investigation response.
  - Facial marks are not
    ecologically relevant
    to deer.
    Their self-model is
    chemical, not facial.
  
OLFACTORY SELF-MODEL EVIDENCE:
  Not formally STSR tested.
  
  BUT: The scent gland system
  provides the strongest
  indirect evidence in any
  mammal for an operational
  olfactory self-model.
  
  SPECIFIC EVIDENCE:

  1. Deer investigate their own
     scrapes extensively.
     They can distinguish
     their own prior markings
     from additions by other
     deer.
     
     Own scent + novel element
     (another deer's mark) →
     extended investigation.
     
     This is the STSR logic
     in field conditions.
     
  2. Rub-urination composition:
     Active blending of
     two chemical elements
     into a unified identity
     signal requires an
     internal model of the
     target signal.
     
     A deer that composes
     its tarsal signature
     knows what that signature
     is.
     
  3. Does and bucks both perform
     scraping and branch-marking
     year-round, not just
     during rut.
     
     This is ongoing olfactory
     self-maintenance, not
     seasonal reproductive
     signaling only.
     
     The olfactory self-model
     is continuously maintained,
     not episodically activated.

CRITICAL STRUCTURAL OBSERVATION:
  
  The deer's scent gland system
  is not just elaborate.
  
  It is modular.
  
  Different glands encode
  different dimensions of
  self-state:
  - Spatial history
    (interdigital)
  - Individual identity
    (tarsal)
  - Social/reproductive status
    (forehead, preputial)
  - Situational state
    (preorbital, alarm)
  
  This is a multi-dimensional
  chemical self-model.
  
  Each gland is a separate
  dimension of self-representation
  that can be updated independently.
  
  A deer in rut has activated
  its forehead and preputial
  dimensions while maintaining
  its baseline tarsal and
  interdigital dimensions.
  
  The self-model has STATE.
  The state changes with
  context.
  The glands express the
  current state.
  
  This is the eigenfunction
  structure of the chemical
  channel applied to self-
  representation.
  
  The deer's body IS the
  bounded resonating system.
  The eigenfunction positions
  are the specific chemical
  compositions each gland
  is optimized to produce.
  Social and ecological
  pressure drives navigation
  toward those positions.

PREDICTED STSR RESULT:
  STRONGLY POSITIVE.
  
  Deer would investigate
  altered own-tarsal-scent
  samples significantly more
  than unaltered samples.
  
  SPECIFIC PREDICTION:
  The response would be
  stronger than in wolves
  or dogs because:
  - The tarsal system is
    more informationally dense
  - The deer actively
    composes its tarsal signal
    (rub-urination) rather
    than passively depositing it
  - The ecological stakes of
    tarsal identity accuracy
    are high (predator detection
    of altered scent, mate
    choice, territory reading)
  
  This prediction is testable.
  It is a direct derivation
  from the framework.

GRADIENT POSITION:
  Currently: not assessed.
  
  Predicted: Stage 2 on
  olfactory self-model gradient,
  potentially the deepest
  olfactory self-model navigation
  depth of any species studied —
  due to seven-gland modular
  architecture and active
  composition behavior.
```

### CASE 5: THE CONTROL CASES —
### GARTER SNAKE AND BALL PYTHON
### (Freiburger et al. 2024)

```
WHY THIS CASE IS CRITICAL:
  The snake result is the sharpest
  empirical finding in the
  entire convergence argument.
  
  It does two things simultaneously:
  
  1. Extends olfactory self-
     recognition to reptiles —
     a non-mammalian class,
     no neocortex, diverged
     from the mammalian lineage
     ~320 million years ago.
     
  2. Provides an internal control
     that tests the sociality
     hypothesis within the same
     methodology, same species
     class, same protocol.

EASTERN GARTER SNAKE
(Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis):
  Social species.
  Forms winter aggregations.
  Recognizes conspecifics.
  Chemical communication central
  to social coordination.
  
  STSR RESULT: POSITIVE.
  Investigates own scent
  altered with novel element
  more than unaltered own scent.
  
  Olfactory self-model operational.

BALL PYTHON
(Python regius):
  Solitary species.
  Minimal conspecific interaction
  except mating season.
  Chemical communication used
  primarily for prey detection
  and environmental orientation,
  not complex social management.
  
  STSR RESULT: NEGATIVE.
  Does not show differential
  investigation of altered
  own scent.

WHAT THIS COMPARISON PROVES:
  
  It is NOT the case that all
  olfactory-dominant species
  have operational olfactory
  self-models.
  
  NECESSARY CONDITION:
  The self-model in the
  olfactory domain requires
  PRESSURE — ecological
  or social — that makes
  own-scent-condition
  relevant to survival
  or reproduction.
  
  Social species: own scent
  condition is socially relevant
  (identity, rank, mate choice).
  Pressure is present.
  Self-model develops.
  
  Solitary species: own scent
  condition is primarily
  relevant for prey/predator
  detection, not for
  managing own social identity.
  Pressure is different.
  Self-model in social-olfactory
  domain is not required.
  
  THIS IS THE MULTI-AXIS
  NAVIGATION DEPTH MODEL
  IN ACTION.
  
  Not all olfactory-dominant
  species have olfactory
  self-models.
  
  Only those where ecological
  or social pressure has
  driven deep navigation
  of the olfactory self-model
  domain.

THE SOCIALITY AXIS CONFIRMED:
  
  The snake finding rehabilitates
  a specific version of the SCH
  within the framework:
  
  Social complexity predicts
  olfactory self-model depth
  in olfactory-dominant species.
  
  This is not the general SCH
  (social complexity predicts
  communication complexity).
  
  This is the domain-specific
  version:
  
  Social complexity in the
  primary-sense domain predicts
  self-model depth in that
  domain.
  
  Ball pythons have social
  complexity too — mating,
  dominance — but it is not
  expressed primarily through
  chemical identity management
  in the way garter snake
  social life is.
  
  The relevant axis is not
  social complexity per se —
  it is whether the primary
  sensory domain is also the
  primary social management
  domain.
  
  When the dominant sense IS
  the social management tool:
  deep self-model in that domain.
  
  When the dominant sense is
  used primarily for ecology
  (prey/predator) not for
  social management: self-model
  in that domain is shallow
  or absent.
```

## PART III: THE CONVERGENCE —
## WHAT THE PATTERN MEANS

### 3.1 The Pattern Stated

Across the cases:

```
DOG (Carnivora, domestic):
  Primary sense: olfactory
  Primary social tool: olfactory
  STSR result: POSITIVE
  Gradient: Stage 1-2 olfactory

WOLF (Carnivora, wild):
  Primary sense: olfactory
  Primary social tool: olfactory
  STSR result: POSITIVE
  Gradient: Stage 1-2 olfactory

GARTER SNAKE (Reptilia, social):
  Primary sense: olfactory/chemical
  Primary social tool: olfactory
  STSR result: POSITIVE
  Gradient: Stage 1+ olfactory

BALL PYTHON (Reptilia, solitary):
  Primary sense: olfactory
  Primary social tool: ecological
  STSR result: NEGATIVE
  Gradient: Stage 0 olfactory

DEER (Artiodactyla):
  Primary sense: olfactory
  Primary social tool: olfactory
  STSR result: UNTESTED but
  indirect evidence: POSITIVE
  Predicted: Stage 2 olfactory

BEAR (Carnivora):
  Primary sense: olfactory
  Primary social tool: ecological
  STSR result: UNTESTED
  Predicted: POSITIVE (ecological
  pressure sufficient even without
  high social complexity)
```

### 3.2 The General Principle
### Derived

The pattern allows the derivation
of a general principle:

**THE MODALITY-SPECIFIC SELF-MODEL
PRINCIPLE:**

```
A species will develop an
operational self-model in
domain D if and only if:

1. Domain D is the species'
   primary or operationally
   dominant sensory channel.

AND

2. The species' own state
   in domain D is ecologically
   or socially relevant —
   meaning: the species has
   a reason to monitor its
   own condition in that domain.

When both conditions are met:
  Navigation depth in the
  domain-specific self-model
  space is high.
  
  The self-model is continuously
  maintained and gap-detection
  is active — anomalies in
  own-state in that domain
  are noticed.
  
  RARFL cycles run when
  anomalies are detected.
  
  The standard test that
  operates in domain D will
  detect the self-model.
  
  Tests operating in other
  domains will fail to detect
  it — not because the self-model
  is absent, but because it
  is not the primary domain.
```

**Ball python fails condition 2.**
Olfactory is primary channel but
own-olfactory-state is not the
primary social management tool.
Own-scent condition is not
self-monitored in the way it
is in social olfactory species.

**Bears satisfy both conditions**
via ecological rather than
social pressure. Own-scent
condition matters enormously
for territory, mating, and
predator management across
vast ranges.

**Deer satisfy both conditions**
at the highest observed level
— seven dedicated gland systems
for self-broadcast, active
composition behavior.

### 3.3 The Convergence
### Is Not Convergent Evolution

Here is the critical claim:

The pattern found across dogs,
wolves, snakes, and (predicted)
deer and bears is NOT five
independent evolutionary
inventions of olfactory
self-recognition.

It is the same ancestral capacity —
the olfactory self-model —
being *exercised* under similar
pressure in independent lineages.

**Under the Self-Awareness
Homology Hypothesis (Springer
2025):**

The common vertebrate ancestor
450 million years ago already
had the functional architecture
for self-model maintenance in
its primary sensory domain.

Every descendant vertebrate
has inherited that capacity.

What varies across species is:

1. **Which sensory domain is
   primary** — shaped by
   ecological niche and
   evolutionary history.

2. **Whether the species'
   own-state in that domain
   is monitored** — shaped
   by social and ecological
   pressure.

Where both are true, the
ancestral self-model capacity
manifests in that domain.

**This reframes the comparative
picture entirely:**

The question is not:
"Has this species evolved
self-awareness?"

The question is:
"In which sensory domain does
this species exercise its
ancestral self-model capacity,
and under what pressure?"

For great apes: visual domain,
social pressure.
For elephants: acoustic + visual,
social + acoustic ecological.
For dogs/wolves: olfactory,
social pressure.
For deer: olfactory, social +
reproductive + territorial.
For bears: olfactory, ecological.
For garter snakes: olfactory,
social.
For cleaner wrasse: visual,
ecological (parasite inspection).

Same capacity.
Different domains.
Different pressures.
Different depths.

**Not convergence. Retention.**

### 3.4 The Measurement
### Implication

Every comparative cognition study
that has tested animals in the
visual domain using the standard
MSR protocol has been running
a biased experiment.

It has been testing one specific
domain expression of a general
capacity.

And calling the result the
presence or absence of the
general capacity itself.

**The corrected methodology:**

For any species, the self-model
test must operate in the
**primary sensory domain**
of that species.

```
SPECIES          PRIMARY DOMAIN    TEST TYPE
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Primates          Visual           Standard MSR
Cetaceans         Acoustic         Acoustic MSR?
Elephants         Acoustic +       Acoustic MSR?
                  Seismic          Seismic MSR?
Dogs/Wolves       Olfactory        STSR
Deer              Olfactory        STSR
Bears             Olfactory        STSR
Cleaner Wrasse    Visual           Standard MSR
  (modified: reversed protocol)
Garter Snakes     Olfactory        STSR
Corvids           Visual +         MSR + audio
                  Acoustic         modification?
```

**For species with acoustic
primary channels (cetaceans,
elephants):**

What would an acoustic MSR
test look like?

This is an open question the
framework now generates.

An acoustic MSR test would
require:
- Recording the animal's own
  vocalizations as the "self"
  baseline
- Modifying the baseline
  (alter the Tonnetz position,
  add a novel element)
- Presenting the modified
  own-voice back to the animal
- Observing whether the animal
  notices the anomaly

Does the whale investigate
modified own-codas more than
unmodified own-codas?

This has not been tested.

If the modality-specific self-
model principle is correct:

**YES.**

The whale should notice when
its own codas have been altered.
The acoustic self-model is
the primary self-model for
cetaceans.

This is a prediction from
first principles.

It is testable.

It has not been tested.

## PART IV: RARFL IN THE
## OLFACTORY DOMAIN

### 4.1 RARFL Expressed in
### Chemical Space

CS doc 6 demonstrated RARFL
in the cleaner wrasse's visual
self-inspection.

The wrasse dropped a shrimp
in front of a mirror to probe
the contingency space.

**What does RARFL look like
in the olfactory domain?**

The answer is less dramatically
visible but structurally identical:

```
RARFL IN OLFACTORY DOMAIN:

EXPLORE:
  Animal encounters its own
  scent mark.
  Detects anomaly: altered
  element present.
  "My mark has changed."

EVALUATE:
  Extended olfactory investigation.
  Multiple sniff passes.
  Chemical analysis of what
  the novel element is.
  "Is this a rival's mark?
  A predator's scent?
  A novel compound from my
  own body state change?"

EXTRACT:
  Classify the anomaly.
  Identify source.
  Extract the stable pattern:
  "My mark was modified by X."
  Or: "My mark has been
  contaminated by Y."

REFINE:
  Update olfactory world-model.
  "My territory boundary at
  this location now contains
  information about X."
  Or: "My own scent has
  changed — I am in a
  different state."

REPEAT:
  Continue along scent trail.
  Check further marks.
  Integrate updated model
  with subsequent evidence.
```

The STSR is testing the EXPLORE
and EVALUATE steps.

The extended investigation of
altered own-scent is the
"shrimp at the mirror" moment.

**It is less visible than
the wrasse's experiment because
it happens inside an olfactory
investigation behavior that
looks, from the outside, like
just sniffing.**

But the structure is identical.

Gap detected. Investigation
initiated. Evaluation run.
Model updated.

RARFL in chemical space.

### 4.2 The Deer as the Most
### Explicit RARFL Case
### in Olfactory Domain

The rub-urination behavior
of deer is the most explicit
observable RARFL cycle in
the olfactory domain:

```
EXPLORE:
  Buck arrives at scrape site.
  Investigates existing scent
  marks (own prior + others').
  Detects gap: "This site's
  olfactory state has changed
  since my last visit."

EVALUATE:
  Reads who has visited.
  Reads their state
  (reproductive status,
  dominance, identity).
  Evaluates implications.

EXTRACT:
  "A dominant buck visited.
  My claim to this scrape
  is contested."
  OR: "A receptive doe visited.
  Reproductive opportunity
  present."

REFINE:
  Modifies own behavior.
  Decision: reinforce mark
  (rub-urinate) or abandon
  scrape.

IF REINFORCE:
  Performs rub-urination —
  active COMPOSITION of
  own chemical identity
  signal.
  The deer composes its
  tarsal signature intentionally.
  Not reflex. Not automatic
  deposit.
  A behavioral decision
  to update the environmental
  olfactory state using
  its own body as the
  signal-generating instrument.

REPEAT:
  Returns to scrape on
  subsequent days.
  Monitors whether the
  olfactory state has changed
  again.
```

The deer at a scrape is running
a RARFL cycle in the olfactory
domain that spans multiple
days, with the environment
as the external memory store.

The scrape is not just a
territory marker.

**The scrape is the deer's
external olfactory working
memory.**

It stores the current state
of the olfactory social landscape
at that location.

The deer reads it, updates
its model, modifies the scrape,
and returns to read again.

This is iterated RARFL
with an environmental substrate
as the persistence layer.

**The deer has invented
external chemical memory.**

Not metaphorically.

A scrape site is a location
where multiple organisms
contribute to and read from
a shared chemical data store.

The deer reads the state.
Evaluates against its own
internal model.
Updates both the internal model
(what is happening in my
territory) and the external
store (rub-urination adds
new information).

This is the most sophisticated
RARFL-visible behavior in the
olfactory domain documented
in any species.

## PART V: THE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK
## CLAIM

### 5.1 The Claim

The evidence across dogs, wolves,
snakes, deer, bears, and the
wrasse supports a single unified
claim:

**SELF-MODEL DEPTH IS A FUNCTION
OF NAVIGATION PRESSURE IN
THE PRIMARY SENSORY DOMAIN.**

```
Formally:

Let D = primary sensory domain
    of species S.

Let P(D) = ecological + social
    pressure on species S
    to maintain accurate
    model of own-state in
    domain D.

Then:

Self-model depth in domain D
  = f(P(D))

And:

Observable self-recognition
in domain D = g(self-model
  depth in D, test methodology
  sensitivity in D)

Where g is monotonically
increasing in both arguments.

COROLLARY:

Standard visual MSR test
measures g(self-model depth
in visual domain, visual
test sensitivity).

For olfactory-primary species:
  visual test sensitivity
  is near zero.
  g → 0 regardless of
  self-model depth.

THEREFORE: visual MSR result
  for olfactory-primary species
  carries no information about
  self-model depth.
```

### 5.2 The Three Findings
### This Unifies

**Finding 1: Wrasse (CS doc 6)**

Visual primary species.
Ecological pressure on visual
self-model (parasite inspection).
Visual MSR: positive.
RARFL visible in behavior.

**Finding 2: Olfactory mammal
convergence (this document)**

Olfactory primary species.
Social and/or ecological pressure
on olfactory self-model.
Visual MSR: fails or untested.
Olfactory STSR: positive.
RARFL running in chemical space.

**Finding 3: Ball python control**

Olfactory primary species.
Low social pressure on
olfactory self-model
(solitary, ecological olfaction
not directed at self-state).
Olfactory STSR: negative.

These three findings are not
separate phenomena.

They are three expressions
of the same principle:

**Self-model depth = navigation
pressure in primary domain.**

The test must match the domain.
The domain is determined by
the niche.
The niche determines what
the self-model is for.

### 5.3 What This Does to the
### Gradient

The triadic gradient (CS doc 1)
needs to be read differently
after this document.

The gradient stages are not
absolute levels of self-awareness.

They are **visibility levels**
in the test methodology that
has been applied.

A deer may be at gradient Stage 2
in the olfactory domain
and gradient Stage 0 in the
visual domain simultaneously.

The gradient instrument must
be domain-specific:

```
REVISED GRADIENT FRAMING:

For any species S, the gradient
position should be assessed
separately for each sensory
domain in which S has significant
ecological/social investment.

S may be at:
  Stage 0 in visual domain
  Stage 2 in olfactory domain
  Stage unknown in acoustic domain

The overall cognitive assessment
of S requires the maximum
across domains — not the visual
domain result alone.

The self-model is as deep as
its deepest domain.
```

**Under this revision:**

Dogs and wolves are not Stage 0
species with no self-awareness.

They are Stage 2 in the olfactory
domain — the domain that matters
for their cognition.

Deer may be Stage 2+ in the
olfactory domain, with the
deepest navigated olfactory
self-model of any studied species.

Bears likely Stage 1-2 in
the olfactory domain, with
ecological rather than social
pressure as the driver.

Snakes: Stage 1 in olfactory
domain (social species) or
Stage 0 (solitary species).

## PART VI: THE OPEN EXPERIMENTS

```
EXPERIMENT 1: BEAR STSR
  Species: Brown bear or
    black bear (captive).
  Protocol: Modified STSR.
    Own-scent (urine or skin
    secretion) with/without
    novel element added.
  Prediction: POSITIVE.
    Bears investigate altered
    own-scent significantly
    more than unaltered.
  Significance: Tests
    ecological-pressure
    pathway to olfactory
    self-model independently
    of social complexity.
    Bears are solitary —
    if they pass, social
    complexity is not required.
    Ecological complexity
    is sufficient.

EXPERIMENT 2: DEER STSR
  Species: White-tailed deer
    (captive or controlled
    field setting).
  Protocol: Modified STSR
    using tarsal gland secretion
    as "self" sample +/- novel
    element addition.
  ALTERNATIVE PROTOCOL:
    Altered scrape — add novel
    scent to a deer's own
    established scrape site.
    Measure investigation time
    vs. own unaltered scrape.
  Prediction: STRONGLY POSITIVE.
    Deer investigate altered
    own scrape significantly
    more than unaltered.
    Response intensity higher
    than in dogs/wolves
    due to seven-gland system
    depth.
  Significance: Tests the most
    elaborate olfactory self-model
    system known. If deer show
    the strongest STSR response,
    it validates the prediction
    that self-model depth scales
    with system elaboration.

EXPERIMENT 3: CETACEAN
  ACOUSTIC SELF-RECOGNITION
  Species: Bottlenose dolphin
    or orca (both have well-
    documented acoustic identity
    signatures — signature whistles
    or pod dialects).
  Protocol: ACOUSTIC STSR.
    Record individual's own
    signature whistle.
    Modify it (alter Tonnetz
    position, add novel element).
    Play back modified own-whistle.
    Observe whether animal
    investigates/responds more
    to modified than unmodified
    own-whistle.
  Prediction: POSITIVE.
    Cetaceans have deep
    acoustic self-models
    (signature whistles are
    individually maintained
    across lifetime).
    Modified own-whistle should
    trigger RARFL cycle.
  Significance: Tests the
    acoustic domain version
    of the self-model principle.
    Connects the olfactory
    convergence finding to
    the CS doc 2 Tonnetz
    framework.
    If cetaceans show acoustic
    self-recognition anomaly
    response, this confirms
    the domain-specific principle
    across both olfactory AND
    acoustic channels.

EXPERIMENT 4: ELEPHANT
  ACOUSTIC/SEISMIC SELF-
  RECOGNITION
  Species: African elephant.
  Protocol: Record individual's
    own infrasound rumble.
    Modify it.
    Play back via speaker
    (airborne) and possibly
    via ground plate (seismic).
    Observe investigation
    response.
  Prediction: POSITIVE.
  Significance: Tests the
    dual-medium prediction
    from CS doc 3 AND the
    acoustic self-model
    principle simultaneously.
    Elephants should show
    modified-own-rumble
    investigation in both
    airborne and seismic
    channels if the dual-medium
    prediction is correct.

EXPERIMENT 5: REVERSED
  PROTOCOL BROADLY APPLIED
  Apply the reversed MSR protocol
  (Sogawa & Kohda 2026) to:
  - Pigs (visual + olfactory)
  - Horses (visual + olfactory)
  - Corvids (visual + acoustic)
  - Domestic cats (olfactory +
    tactile)
  
  For each: identify the primary
  domain and apply the reversed
  protocol in that domain.
  
  Prediction: Most will show
    positive results in their
    primary domain.
  
  Significance: Systematically
    maps the revised gradient
    across species.
    Would represent the largest
    single advance in comparative
    cognition since Gallup's
    original 1970 mirror test.
```

## PART VII: THE SINGLE CLEAREST
## STATEMENT THIS DOCUMENT MAKES

The question is not:
*Which species are smart enough
to have self-awareness?*

The question is:
*In which sensory domain does
this species maintain its
self-model, and has anyone
tested it there?*

Dogs failed the visual mirror test
because they are not primarily
visual creatures.

They live in a chemical world.

Their self-model is chemical.

When we finally tested the
chemical world — Horowitz 2017,
one study, thirty-seven years
after Gallup's original mirror
test — the answer was immediate:

Of course the dog knows what
it smells like.

Of course it notices when
its own scent has been altered.

It has been doing this for
its entire life.

Every time it investigates
a scent mark.

Every time it reads the chemical
history of a patch of ground.

Every time it encounters its own
prior trail.

The self-model has been
operational the entire time.

The test just wasn't in the
right domain.

**The bear at the rub tree,
depositing its chemical signature.**

**The deer performing rub-urination,
composing its tarsal identity
in real time.**

**The wolf returning to its
own scent mark to read whether
anything has changed.**

**The dog spending extra time
with a scent canister that
smells like itself but different.**

**None of these animals failed
to be self-aware.**

**We failed to ask them the
question in their language.**
