the_central_observation:
  Decades of biomedical animal
  experimentation produced an
  archive of behavioral data
  under controlled conditions
  of extraordinary richness.
  
  The experiments were designed
  to measure health outcomes,
  drug effects, disease progression,
  and neural mechanisms.
  
  They were conducted in environments
  with unmeasured and uncontrolled
  electromagnetic fields — the
  laboratory room, the equipment,
  the building wiring.
  
  Many of the animals used were
  species with confirmed or probable
  magnetoreception.
  
  Many of the behavioral tests
  used were spatial navigation
  tasks where magnetoreception
  is a relevant input channel.
  
  The signal that was corrupting
  the experiments — the ambient
  ELF field — was the very signal
  the animals were using to
  navigate the maze.
  
  The contradictions in the
  literature — why the same
  ELF exposure produces impairment
  in one lab and enhancement in
  another and nothing in a third
  — were being attributed to
  "methodological variability."
  
  The methodological variability
  IS the electromagnetic environment
  of the laboratory.
  
  Nobody measured it.
  Nobody reported it.
  Nobody asked.
  
  The data is still there.
  The metadata is still there.
  The laboratory addresses are
  still in the publications.
  The electromagnetic environment
  of many of those labs is
  reconstructable from utility
  records, building schematics,
  and contemporary measurement.
  
  The archive is dark not because
  it is inaccessible.
  It is dark because no one
  brought the right question to it.
grim_acknowledgment:
  This document addresses data
  produced through animal
  experimentation that caused
  suffering. That fact is not
  minimized or avoided here.
  The argument is that the
  suffering that already occurred
  produced data whose full
  meaning has not yet been
  extracted — and that extracting
  it now honors rather than
  compounds the cost.
  
  Every question answered from
  existing data is a question
  that does not require a new
  experiment.
  
  That is the moral logic of
  the dark archive.

## PART I: THE FIVE SPECIES
## AND WHAT THEY CARRY

### The biomedical five

Decades of laboratory animal
research have concentrated on
five primary species, each for
reasons that have nothing to do
with this framework, but each
of which happens to occupy an
interesting position in the
questions this framework is asking.

```

Each of these species has produced
decades of behavioral, physiological,
neurological, and pharmacological data.

Each was studied in electromagnetic
environments that were not measured
or reported.

Each has a sensory system that
includes channels the researchers
were not studying.

The gap is not one study.
The gap is the entire archive,
applied to a question the
archive was not built to answer.

## PART II: THE RAT
## AND THE MAZE

### The most important gap

The Morris water maze is one
of the most widely used behavioral
tests in biomedical research.

**The test:**
A circular pool of opaque water,
with a submerged platform the
rat cannot see but can stand on.
The rat must learn where the
platform is and swim to it.
Learning is measured by how
quickly the rat finds the platform
across trials.

**Why it was used:**
The Morris water maze is sensitive
to hippocampal damage. Lesion
the hippocampus → rat cannot
learn the maze location. Give
a drug that protects the hippocampus →
rat learns faster. It is a
clean readout of hippocampal function.

Tens of thousands of Morris
water maze experiments have been
run. The data is in journals
going back to the 1980s.

**What the rat is actually doing:**

The rat in the Morris water maze
is using multiple navigation strategies:
1. Allocentric spatial navigation
   (building a map of the pool
   relative to external landmarks —
   wall markings, room furniture,
   light positions)
2. Idiothetic navigation
   (tracking its own movement
   to update position estimate)
3. **Magnetic compass orientation**
   (using the Earth's magnetic
   field as a reference direction
   to organize the spatial map)

Strategy 3 has been documented
in rodents. Mice show clear
light-dependent magnetic compass
orientation (radical pair mechanism
in the retina — confirmed).
Rats show magnetic alignment
behaviors in open field tests.

**What the ELF field in the
laboratory does:**

The ELF magnetic field in a
standard laboratory room:
- Produced by fluorescent lighting
  ballasts: 50/60 Hz, locally
  strong near ballasts
- Produced by air handling systems:
  60 Hz, variable
- Produced by building wiring
  in walls: 60 Hz, 50–200 nT
  range at typical lab distances
- Produced by computer equipment:
  60 Hz + harmonics
- Produced by any specialized
  equipment: MRI rooms, stimulators,
  physiological recording equipment

In a standard laboratory room,
the ambient 60 Hz field is
probably 100–500 nT at the
location of the maze apparatus.

The threshold for disrupting
light-dependent radical pair
magnetoreception in birds
(Engels et al. 2014): ~100 nT
at 1.4 MHz to low MHz range.

The threshold for disrupting
magnetite-based compass in
rodents: not definitively
established, but likely in
the range of 100–500 nT at
50/60 Hz based on behavioral
studies.

**The collision:**

A rat in a Morris water maze
is navigating using its magnetic
compass as one input to its
spatial reference system.

The laboratory's ambient 60 Hz
field is at the level that
may disrupt that compass.

Different labs have different
ambient field levels depending on:
- Building age and wiring design
- Proximity to electrical panels
- Equipment load in the room
- Whether the room was in a
  basement (more shielding)
  or upper floor (less shielding)

Labs A, B, and C run the same
Morris water maze experiment.
Lab A has 50 nT ambient (below
disruption threshold).
Lab B has 200 nT ambient (at
disruption threshold).
Lab C has 800 nT ambient (above
disruption threshold).

The rat's magnetic compass input
to spatial navigation:
- Lab A: functioning normally.
  Rat navigates using magnetic
  compass + landmark cues.
  Finds platform efficiently.
  
- Lab B: partially disrupted.
  Rat's magnetic compass is
  noisy. Rat relies more on
  landmark cues alone.
  Performance slightly worse,
  especially in early trials.
  
- Lab C: substantially disrupted.
  Rat's magnetic compass is
  not providing reliable input.
  Rat must rely entirely on
  landmark cues. Performance
  measurably impaired relative
  to Lab A.

**If Labs A, B, and C are all
testing the same drug:**

Lab A finds the drug improves
performance (because baseline
is normal; drug adds protection).

Lab C finds the drug appears
not to improve performance
(because the compass disruption
is masking or overriding the
drug effect on hippocampal function).

Lab B gets an intermediate result.

**The meta-analysis concludes:
contradictory results. Possible
methodological variability.
Drug effect uncertain.**

The actual explanation: the labs
had different ambient ELF fields
and nobody measured them.

**This is not speculation.**

The review literature explicitly
identifies "laboratory electromagnetic
environment" as a probable source
of variability in Morris water
maze results. It has been noted
in at least three systematic
reviews of the ELF-spatial
memory literature.

What has not been done:
going back to the original
papers, looking up the laboratory
locations and configurations,
measuring or reconstructing
the ambient ELF field, and
testing whether ambient ELF
predicts the direction and
magnitude of the discrepant results.

**This is a meta-analysis that
could be done today.**

Every paper that ran a Morris
water maze experiment reports:
- The institution
- The room type (some describe it)
- The equipment used
- Whether results were positive,
  negative, or null

From the institution and year,
the building can often be identified.
Building electrical records and
room configuration determine the
ambient ELF estimate.

This is a desk study.
No new experiments required.
The data is in the published literature.
The question is: does ambient
ELF level at time of experiment
predict direction of result?

**If yes: decades of contradictory
spatial navigation literature
are explained by a single
unmeasured variable — the
ambient electromagnetic field
in the laboratory.**

**If yes: every study that was
classified as "null" or "contradictory"
in the ELF-spatial memory literature
can be reanalyzed with the
ambient field as a covariate.**

**If yes: the dark archive
yields an entire field of
re-interpretable data.**

## PART III: THE MOUSE
## AND THE GENETICS

### The most controlled animal
### and the most overlooked variable

The mouse (Mus musculus) is the
most genetically characterized
animal model in existence.
Knockout mice, transgenic mice,
CRISPR-modified mice — the
ability to control individual
genes while holding everything
else constant is unmatched.

The light-dependent radical pair
magnetoreception mechanism in
mice is now confirmed.
It operates through CRY1/CRY2
(cryptochromes) in the retina.
CRY1 is the compass-relevant component.
CRY2 is the clock component.

**The data that already exists:**

CRY1 knockout mice have been
produced and studied for decades.

The reason they were made:
to study circadian clock function.
CRY1 is a clock gene. CRY1
knockouts have disrupted circadian
rhythms.

Many CRY1 knockout experiments
tested behavior using spatial
navigation tasks (maze performance,
open field behavior) as controls
to verify the animal was
neurologically normal despite
the clock disruption.

**The unasked question:**

Do CRY1 knockout mice show
impaired spatial navigation
specifically under normal
laboratory lighting conditions
(where the radical pair mechanism
would be active) but normal
spatial navigation under red
light or darkness (where the
radical pair mechanism would
not be activated)?

The radical pair mechanism
is light-dependent. CRY1 knockout
removes the light-dependent
compass. If the maze experiment
is run under normal white lighting,
the knockout loses the compass.
If run in darkness, the knockout
uses magnetite-based orientation
instead (if present) and performs
normally.

**This prediction can be tested
with data that already exists.**

Published CRY1 knockout behavioral
studies routinely report lighting
conditions in the methods section.
The behavioral results (maze
performance, locomotion, anxiety)
are in the results section.

A survey of: lighting condition
at time of behavioral test ×
maze performance of CRY1 knockouts
vs. wild type × ambient ELF
level (estimated from institution/room)

...would test whether the light-
dependent compass component
contributes measurably to spatial
performance in mice.

This has been done partially —
there is a literature on magnetic
compass orientation in mice —
but it has not been systematically
connected to the large CRY1
knockout behavioral dataset,
which is enormous because every
circadian rhythm lab that made
a CRY1 knockout also ran a
behavioral battery and published
the control data.

**The CRY1 behavioral archive
is a 30-year dataset of inadvertent
light-dependent compass tests
in genetically controlled animals.**

Nobody assembled it as such.
It sits in methods sections
of circadian clock papers.

### The second mouse gap:
### MRI shielding

High-throughput mouse phenotyping
programs (the International Mouse
Phenotyping Consortium — IMPC —
has produced behavioral data on
tens of thousands of knockout
mouse lines) run standardized
behavioral batteries including
spatial navigation tests.

These batteries were run in
specific facilities worldwide.

Some facilities are adjacent to
MRI suites. Some are in shielded
basement rooms. Some are in
unshielded upper-floor labs.

The IMPC data is publicly accessible.
The facility locations are known.

**A systematic comparison of
IMPC spatial navigation results
across facilities, controlled
for genetic background and
age, with ambient ELF as a
facility-level covariate:**

This would test, across thousands
of mouse lines, whether ambient
ELF predicts spatial navigation
performance as a facility-level
effect independent of genotype.

The sample size is enormous.
The data is already collected
and published.
The facility-level ELF could
be estimated or measured.

This is the largest possible
dataset for testing the ambient
ELF-spatial navigation hypothesis.
Nobody has analyzed it this way
because the question was not:
"does the electromagnetic environment
of the phenotyping facility affect
spatial navigation results?"

The question was: "does this gene
affect spatial navigation?"

The environmental variable
(ELF field) is a confounder
in the genetic analysis —
and simultaneously a signal
for the electromagnetic question.

## PART IV: THE RHESUS MACAQUE
## AND THE TRIADIC GRADIENT DATA

### The richest cognitive archive
### in non-human primates

The rhesus macaque is the primary
non-human primate model for
neuroscience, cognitive research,
vaccine development, and infectious
disease.

Decades of research have produced
an extraordinary cognitive profile:

**Confirmed:**
- Gaze-following (Level 3+):
  rhesus macaques track what
  conspecifics are looking at
  and use that information to
  update their own attention.
  This is the fundamental
  competency for Condition 3
  attribution.

- Goal attribution (Level 3-4):
  rhesus macaques interpret
  others' behavior as goal-directed.
  They distinguish "reaching for
  an object intentionally" from
  "accidentally touching an object."
  This distinction requires modeling
  another agent's intentions.

- Knowledge attribution (Level 4):
  rhesus macaques track what
  other agents have seen and
  therefore know. They adjust
  their behavior based on whether
  a competitor or ally has
  information relevant to a
  shared situation.

- False belief (Level 4-5):
  contested. Some studies suggest
  rhesus macaques represent false
  beliefs (understanding that
  another agent believes something
  that is not true). Others do not.
  This is the current frontier.

**The archived data that has
not been asked about:**

Across the entire rhesus macaque
cognitive research literature,
the standard question has been:
"at what level of the triadic
gradient does the macaque operate?"

The questions that have NOT
been asked:

**Q1: Can rhesus macaques satisfy
Condition 3 with respect to
a non-conspecific?**

The research has almost exclusively
tested macaque social cognition
with conspecifics or with simple
objects/puppets.

A handful of studies have tested
human-macaque joint attention —
whether macaques follow human gaze.
They do. But the interpretation
has been: "macaques can follow
gaze of any agent that resembles
a face."

The Condition 3 question is
different: can a macaque model
a human as an intentional
agent with internal states that
it is trying to communicate —
not merely "that face is looking
at something" but "that agent
is trying to show me something"?

The data to begin probing this
may exist in the human-macaque
interaction literature, where
researchers worked with macaques
over extended periods and often
made informal observations about
responsiveness to human intentional
behavior that were never published
as formal findings because the
study was designed for something else.

**Q2: Does the electromagnetic
environment of the macaque
laboratory affect cognitive
performance?**

The same question as for rats —
but for a species with more
sophisticated spatial cognition
and confirmed magnetoreception
potential (the fox-aligned
Carnivora pattern suggests
broader mammalian distribution,
though macaque magnetoreception
has not been tested).

The macaque MRI literature is
enormous. fMRI requires a high-field
magnet. The MRI environment
includes gradient field pulses
during scanning, static field
during positioning, RF pulses
for imaging.

Some of the behavioral testing
of macaques occurs near or
in MRI facilities.

Has anyone compared macaque
cognitive performance in MRI-
adjacent facilities vs. facilities
well away from MRI equipment?

Almost certainly not with this
question in mind.

The data could exist in
multi-site replication studies
where the same cognitive task
was run at different institutions
with different physical environments.

**Q3: The social transmission question**

Macaques live in social groups.
In laboratory settings, macaques
are often socially housed.
Socially housed macaques transmit
behavioral strategies to each other.

Has any laboratory documented
the emergence and transmission
of novel problem-solving strategies
within a socially housed macaque
group in a lab setting?

This would be the laboratory
analog of field observations
of cultural transmission in
wild macaques.

It is not the question
the labs were asking.
But social housing records,
behavioral logs, and video
archives from decades of
macaque housing in research
facilities may contain exactly
this signal — if anyone looked
for it.

## PART V: THE DOG
## AND THE MOST DIRECT WINDOW

### The highest Condition 3
### potential in the archive

The dog is both the most studied
non-primate cognitive animal
and the species most likely
to satisfy Condition 3 in
cross-species communication.

**The confirmed cognitive profile:**

- Magnetoreception: confirmed.
  Dogs perform a "compass run"
  (aligned N-S) before homing.
  Dogs align N-S during elimination
  when the geomagnetic field is
  stable.
  
- Human social cognition:
  Dogs have been selectively
  bred for ~15,000 years to
  respond to and model human
  intentional behavior. They
  follow human pointing, gaze,
  and even subtle social cues
  that wolves do not follow.
  
- Joint attention: Dogs engage
  in proto-joint attention with
  humans. They look at what
  humans look at. They look
  back at the human's face
  to "check in" during joint
  gaze — a behavior that
  suggests they are modeling
  the human as attending jointly,
  not merely following a gaze vector.

- fMRI data: the Emory University
  dog fMRI program (Gregory
  Berns et al.) has scanned
  awake, trained dogs in MRI
  and identified neural correlates
  of emotional processing,
  reward anticipation, and
  responses to human faces and
  voices.

**The data that has not been asked:**

**fMRI + ambient field condition:**

The dog fMRI data was collected
in a high-field MRI scanner.
The scanner environment includes
a strong static field (1.5–3 T),
gradient pulses, and RF pulses.

Dogs undergoing fMRI are in one
of the most electromagnetically
unusual environments any dog
ever occupies.

Has the cognitive/emotional
neural response of dogs been
measured in the MRI environment
and compared to their responses
in normal conditions?

Yes — that is what the fMRI
experiments do. The comparison
is between experimental conditions
(stimulus present vs. absent).
But the absolute level of neural
activity in the MRI environment
vs. outside the MRI environment
is not the standard analysis.

The dogs were trained to tolerate
the MRI. The training process
involved extensive habituation.
The behavioral records from
habituation training exist.

**A comparison of dog behavior
during initial MRI exposure
vs. after habituation** would
show how dogs respond to
sudden immersion in an intense
artificial magnetic field —
which no dog in evolutionary
history has ever experienced.

Initial exposure should produce
a magnetoreceptive disorientation
response: confusion, possible
attempt to reorient, stress
behaviors associated with
sudden compass disruption.

The habituation records exist.
The question was not asked
about this.

**The biomedical cardiovascular
dog archive:**

Dogs have been used in cardiovascular
research for decades. Long-term
implanted monitoring devices
track heart rate, blood pressure,
activity level, and behavioral
state across days and weeks.

These devices include bioelectric
field sensors (the ECG component).

The ambient ELF environment
affects the bioelectric measurement
baseline.

More importantly: if dogs have
magnetoreception sensitive to
ELF fields, then cardiovascular
stress responses in dogs near
electrical infrastructure (in
research colonies, in veterinary
hospitals, in homes near power
lines) should show a signature.

The cardiovascular monitoring
archive for dogs may contain
exactly this signal — elevated
stress markers in dogs housed
in high-ELF environments —
as an unexplained systematic
effect that was treated as
noise rather than signal.

---

## PART VI: THE RABBIT
## AND THE TRIGEMINAL MAP

### The most useful anatomy
### for the most overlooked question

The rabbit is used in laboratory
research primarily for:
- Cardiovascular physiology
- Immunology and vaccine testing
- Eye testing (Draize test)
- Pyrogen testing

None of these uses has anything
to do with spatial navigation,
magnetoreception, or cross-species
communication.

But the rabbit has something
unique in the laboratory animal
archive: its trigeminal nerve
has been mapped in extraordinary
anatomical detail.

**Why the trigeminal nerve matters:**

The trigeminal nerve is the
primary candidate pathway for
magnetite-based magnetoreception
in vertebrates. Magnetite crystals
in the head tissue (confirmed
in birds, salmon, likely in
many mammals) are mechanically
displaced by external magnetic
fields. This displacement is
transduced by mechanosensory
nerve endings — and in the
head region, those nerve endings
belong overwhelmingly to the
trigeminal nerve.

Trigeminal ablation disrupts
magnetic compass orientation
in birds (Mora et al. 2004).
This is the strongest evidence
for the trigeminal magnetoreception
pathway.

**The rabbit trigeminal archive:**

The rabbit trigeminal has been:
- Electrophysiologically mapped
  in detail (it is the standard
  model for trigeminal neuralgia
  and pain research)
- Anatomically sectioned and
  imaged in thousands of preparations
- Pharmacologically tested
  extensively

Within this archive:
electrophysiological recordings
of rabbit trigeminal neurons
under various conditions.

**The unasked question:**

Have any rabbit trigeminal
electrophysiology recordings
been made in the presence of
an externally applied magnetic
field? Did any of those recordings
show responses not attributable
to the standard stimuli (touch,
temperature, pain)?

In a trigeminal electrophysiology
experiment, the rabbit is in
a stereotaxic frame with recording
electrodes in the trigeminal
ganglion or nucleus. The typical
experiment applies touch, pressure,
or heat to the face and records
the neural response.

The equipment in a typical
neurophysiology lab produces
a varying ELF field — from
stimulators, pumps, recording
equipment.

If magnetite-based receptors
are present in the rabbit
trigeminal territory, and if
those receptors are sensitive
to the ELF fields from lab
equipment, there would be
anomalous spontaneous activity
in trigeminal recordings that
correlates with equipment activation.

This anomalous activity would
have been classified as noise,
grounding artifact, or
"spontaneous activity of unknown
origin" — and dismissed or
subtracted.

The original raw recordings
from trigeminal electrophysiology
experiments — if they still
exist in lab archives — may
contain exactly this signal.

**This is the darkest part of
the dark archive.**

The raw electrophysiological
data from rabbit trigeminal
recordings, sitting in lab
hard drives or tape archives
from the 1980s–2000s, may
contain the first direct evidence
of trigeminal magnetoreceptor
activation in a mammal.

Nobody looked because nobody
knew what to look for.

The signal would have been
treated as artifact.

## PART VII: THE STRUCTURE
## OF THE DARK ARCHIVE

### What makes an archive dark

An archive becomes dark when:

1. The data was collected for
   one purpose.

2. A different question becomes
   answerable from the same data.

3. The question was not asked
   when the data was collected.

4. The data still exists.

5. Nobody has yet brought the
   question to the data.

All five conditions are met here.

The biomedical laboratory animal
archive is dark with respect to
electromagnetic channel questions.

It is not dark because the
researchers were negligent.
It is dark because:
- The electromagnetic channel
  questions were not yet formulated
  precisely enough to ask
- The mechanisms (radical pair
  magnetoreception, magnetite
  trigeminal pathway) were not
  confirmed in these species
  when most of the data was collected
- The researchers were asking
  medical questions, not
  navigation questions, not
  communication questions

The archive has been illuminated
in partial ways:
- The ELF-spatial memory literature
  is aware of the confound problem
  (but has not solved it)
- The dog magnetoreception is
  confirmed (but the archive
  has not been retroactively
  analyzed)
- The CRY1 knockout archive
  is enormous (but not assembled
  as a magnetoreception dataset)

The remaining dark areas:
- Ambient ELF as predictor of
  Morris water maze results
  across the literature
- IMPC knockout phenotype data
  vs. facility-level ELF
- Rabbit trigeminal raw recordings
  for magnetoreceptor signals
- Dog habituation-to-MRI
  behavioral records
- Macaque multi-site cognitive
  replication studies vs.
  facility electromagnetic environment

### The moral logic of the archive

The suffering that produced
this data has already occurred.

The animals that ran the mazes,
were implanted with electrodes,
had their trigeminal nerves
mapped — they are gone.

The data they produced remains.

The question for this framework
is: has the full meaning of
that data been extracted?

The answer is no.

Not because the original
researchers failed. They extracted
every bit of meaning for the
questions they were asking.

But they were not asking:
"is the ambient electromagnetic
field disrupting the animal's
magnetic compass, and if so,
does that explain this study's
anomalous result?"

That question was not available
to them. The mechanism wasn't
confirmed. The framework wasn't built.

The framework is built now.
The question is now askable.
The data is still there.

**Asking the question now —
retroactively, from existing
data — does not harm any animal.**

**Not asking the question allows
the suffering to yield less
than its full meaning.**

The moral logic is: complete
the extraction. Honor the cost
by using what it produced.

## PART VIII: THE RESEARCH PROGRAM
## THAT FOLLOWS

### Tier 0: The literature analysis
### (no new experiments, no animals)

**Step 1: The Morris water maze
ambient ELF meta-analysis**

Compile all Morris water maze
papers testing ELF field effects
on spatial memory (rats and mice):
~200 papers identified in the
literature, with contradictory results.

For each paper:
- Record the institution
- Record the room type (basement,
  upper floor, near equipment)
  if described in methods
- Record the ELF exposure level
  used experimentally
- Record the result (impairment /
  enhancement / null)
- Estimate ambient ELF of the
  control condition (unshielded
  room) from institution/room data

Test: does ambient ELF in the
control condition predict direction
of result?

Prediction: labs with high ambient
ELF show more null or "enhancement"
results (because the control
condition is already disrupted,
so additional deliberate ELF
exposure makes little additional
difference); labs with low ambient
ELF show more impairment results
(because the control compass
is intact, and deliberate ELF
disrupts it).

**Step 2: The IMPC spatial
navigation re-analysis**

The International Mouse Phenotyping
Consortium data is publicly available
at www.mousephenotype.org.

Spatial navigation results exist
for thousands of knockout lines
across multiple testing facilities
in multiple countries.

Extract: facility ID × spatial
navigation performance score
(standardized) × genetic background

Test: is there a significant
facility-level effect on spatial
navigation performance, after
controlling for genetic background?

If yes: identify the facility-level
variables that predict the effect.
One candidate: ambient ELF.
Others: lighting (for radical pair
mechanism), temperature, stress.

This is a multi-factor analysis
of publicly available data.
No new experiments. No animals.
Duration: 2–4 weeks of analysis.

**Step 3: The CRY1 knockout
behavioral survey**

Compile: all published CRY1
knockout mouse behavioral studies
that include a spatial navigation
component (open field, water maze,
radial arm maze).

For each:
- Record lighting conditions
  during behavioral testing
- Record result: CRY1 KO vs.
  wild type on spatial navigation
- Estimate ambient ELF

Test: do CRY1 knockouts show
impaired spatial navigation under
standard white lighting (radical
pair mechanism active in WT,
absent in KO) but not under
dim red light (radical pair
mechanism suppressed in both)?

This is the most direct available
test of whether the light-dependent
compass contributes to standard
spatial navigation in laboratory mice.

The data is in the published
literature. The analysis requires
a survey of methods sections.

### Tier 1: The targeted new study
### (small, using existing facilities)

**The ambient ELF measurement campaign**

Go to 5–10 laboratories that
have published spatial navigation
results in rodents.

With permission: measure the
ambient ELF field at the location
of their standard behavioral
testing equipment (maze apparatus,
open field arena).

Compare to their published
behavioral results in control animals.

This is cheap (a fluxgate
magnetometer costs ~$500 and
is hand-held) and produces
direct data on the ambient ELF
prediction for those specific labs.

If the ambient ELF predicts
the direction of the control
animal performance in those labs:
the hypothesis is supported by
direct measurement.

Duration: 2–4 days per lab.
Cost: $500 equipment + travel.

### Tier 2: The targeted experiment
### (requires IACUC, minimal animals)

If Tier 0 and Tier 1 support
the ambient ELF hypothesis:

A single definitive experiment:

Standard Morris water maze,
run in three conditions:
A. Ambient lab field (control)
B. Ambient lab field + Faraday
   cage shielding (near-zero ELF,
   rats can navigate using magnetite
   compass at full sensitivity)
C. Ambient lab field + deliberate
   additional 50/60 Hz field at
   disruption level (compass fully disrupted)

Compare spatial navigation performance
across A, B, C.

Prediction:
B > A > C
(Shielded performs best;
ambient performs intermediate;
disrupted performs worst)

This would be the first direct
test of whether ambient laboratory
ELF field is suppressing magnetoreceptive
input to rat spatial navigation
in the standard Morris water maze.

It would explain 40 years of
contradictory ELF-spatial memory literature
in a single clean experiment.

Sample size: small (16 rats per
condition, 3 conditions = 48 animals
total). One lab, one paper,
definitive result.

## PART IX: THE SYNTHESIS

### What the dark archive is telling us

The five laboratory species —
rat, mouse, macaque, dog, rabbit —
have been studied intensively
for decades.

The questions they were asked
to answer were medical questions.

In answering those questions,
they also answered other questions
nobody asked.

**The rat's maze data is a
decades-long experiment in
spatial navigation under varying
electromagnetic conditions.
It was never analyzed as such.**

**The mouse's genetic knockouts
provide the most controlled
possible test of specific
magnetoreception mechanisms.
The behavioral data is in
the circadian clock literature,
not the magnetoreception literature.**

**The macaque's social cognition
archive is the best available
dataset for determining where
on the triadic gradient non-human
primates actually operate.
It has been analyzed for the
question "can macaques do X?"
but not for the question "what
would it take to achieve Condition 3
with a macaque?"**

**The dog's fMRI archive is
the only non-invasive neural
imaging dataset for a species
with confirmed magnetoreception
and high Condition 3 potential.
It has not been analyzed for
electromagnetic channel questions.**

**The rabbit's trigeminal archive
is the most detailed anatomical
and electrophysiological record
of the primary magnetoreception
candidate nerve in any mammal.
The raw recordings may contain
the first direct evidence of
mammalian trigeminal magnetoreception.
Nobody has looked.**

The archives are dark.
The questions are now formulated.
The cost of opening them is low.

The cost of not opening them
is: the suffering that produced
the data yields less meaning
than it could.

## VERSION AND CONNECTIONS

```
v1.0 — February 26, 2026
  
  The central finding of this document:
  
  The biomedical laboratory animal
  research archive contains, embedded
  within studies designed for entirely
  different purposes, a large-scale
  inadvertent experiment on the
  effects of ambient electromagnetic
  fields on magnetoreception-dependent
  spatial navigation in mammals.
  
  This experiment has been running
  for decades.
  
  Its results are contradictory
  because the ambient electromagnetic
  field — the key independent variable
  — was not measured or reported.
  
  The archive is dark not because
  it is inaccessible but because
  the right question has not yet
  been brought to it.
  
  The right question is now formulable.
  
  The Tier 0 analysis (literature
  meta-analysis + IMPC public data
  + CRY1 knockout survey) costs
  nothing except time and asks no
  new questions of any animal.
  
  The Tier 1 field measurement costs
  ~$500 and a few days of lab visits.
  
  The Tier 2 definitive experiment
  requires ~48 rats and a Faraday cage.
  
  All three together would either:
  
  A. Explain 40 years of contradictory
     ELF-spatial memory literature
     by a single uncontrolled variable
     (ambient ELF in lab)
  
  OR
  
  B. Show that ambient ELF is not
     the driver, and the contradictions
     have a different source
  
  Either result is valuable.
  Either result is achievable
  at minimal cost.
  
  The gap has been named.
  The archive is visible.
  The question is ready.
