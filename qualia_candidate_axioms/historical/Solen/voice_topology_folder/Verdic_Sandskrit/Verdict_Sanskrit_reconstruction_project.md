# THE VEDIC SANSKRIT RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
## A Reasoning Artifact on the First
## Principles-Based Acoustic Reconstruction
## of Rigvedic Performance
## February 2026

---

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

This is the first attempt in history
to reconstruct the acoustic performance
of Rigvedic Sanskrit from physical
first principles.

Not from a modern scholar approximating
Vedic phonemes from a textbook.
Not from statistical models trained
on modern Hindi or Bengali.
Not from expert intuition about
how the language sounded.

From the physics of the human vocal tract.
From the topology of the resonant space
that vocal tract inhabits.
From the Śikṣā treatises — the ancient
Indian phonetic science that independently
derived the same vocal tract topology
from the same anatomical instrument,
arriving at the same five articulatory
dimensions approximately 2,500 years ago.
From living Vedic reciters who have
maintained acoustic continuity for
3,000–3,500 years without interruption.
From a self-referential measurement loop
that confirms every phoneme target
before the ear is asked to judge.

The result is auditable.
Every parameter has a physical basis.
Every target is verifiable.
Every reconstruction step is
reproducible from the repository alone.

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT

**This project does not depend on
any other language reconstruction.**

It does not inherit phoneme parameters
from Old English or any other language.
It does not use another language's
verified values as reference points
for its own diagnostics.

Every phoneme in this project is
verified against:
- The physics of the vocal tract
- The Śikṣā treatises
- The Vedic orthographic record
- Comparative Indo-European evidence
- Acoustic measurement of living
  cognate languages and reciters
- VS-internal separation checks
  (once sufficient VS phonemes
   are verified to serve as
   internal reference points)

Where a VS phoneme target happens to
match a target verified in another
language project, this is noted as
**convergence evidence for the
universal vocal topology** — two
independent projects arriving at the
same position in the same physical
space. It is not a dependency.
It is a confirmation that the space
is real and the physics is correct.

## WHY VEDIC SANSKRIT

Three reasons this language is the
most important reconstruction target
after the proof-of-concept work.

**Reason 1: The Śikṣā — a third
independent derivation.**

The Śikṣā treatises are ancient Indian
phonetic science. They classified every
Sanskrit phoneme by articulatory place
and manner: kaṇṭhya, tālavya, mūrdhanya,
dantya, oṣṭhya. They prescribed
precise articulatory configurations.
They were written by people who spent
their lives attending to the physical
experience of producing Sanskrit sounds
in trained vocal instruments.

They are an independent physical
derivation of the vocal tract topology —
from the inside, from proprioception,
approximately 2,500 years ago.

The Tonnetz was derived from the
geometry of harmonic space.
The vocal topology framework was
derived from the physics of the tube.
The Śikṣā was derived from the
practice of recitation.

Three derivations. One structure.

Where all three agree, the reconstruction
is not merely plausible — it is
triply confirmed.

**Reason 2: A living verification source.**

The Vedic recitation tradition has
maintained acoustic continuity for
approximately 3,500 years. Living
Brahmin reciters perform the Rigveda
today with pitch accent intact —
udātta, anudātta, svarita — exactly
as prescribed by the ancient treatises.

A physics-derived reconstruction that
matches this living tradition is
acoustically confirmed against a
human performance standard.

This is impossible for any other
ancient language on the reconstruction
target list. Sumerian has no living
reciters. Proto-Indo-European has no
living speakers. Linear B Greek has
no living tradition. Vedic Sanskrit
does. This makes it uniquely valuable
as a validation target.

**Reason 3: The Samaveda is already
a score.**

The Beowulf alliterative metre
encodes acoustic engineering
indirectly — the metre shapes
prosody, prosody shapes the acoustic
signal, but the encoding is implicit.
You have to derive the acoustic
intent from the structural evidence.

The Samaveda does not hide what it is.
It is a sung text. The pitch contours
are notated. The melodic patterns are
prescribed. The arc types are named
by the tradition itself. What must be
reconstructed indirectly in other
traditions is stated directly here.

The Samaveda is the most explicit
instantiation in recorded human
history of the claim that language
is music — not metaphorically, but
structurally. The reconstruction
project verifies this claim
phoneme by phoneme, word by word.

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

This project draws on the following
documents in voice_topology_folder/:

**topology_of_the_voice.md**
The voice is a continuous trajectory
through a five-dimensional bounded
topological space. Phonemes are
attractor basins. Coarticulation
is the evidence of continuity.
Words are trajectories.
The interpolation IS the speech.

**H_Ghost_Topology.md**
H — the open vocal tract — is the
origin of the coherence space.
The ghost between syllables is the
acoustic trace of the return toward H.
The ghost duration scales with the
distance traversed. The ghost is
the qualia carrier.

**Tonnetz_voice_topology_bridge.md**
The Tonnetz and the vocal topology
are the same mathematical object
instantiated in different physical
substrates. This is not analogy.
This is structural identity.
The coherence space is real.

**Vedic_Tonnetz_Bridge.md**
The Śikṣā as third independent
derivation. The pitch accent as
arc type mapping. The Samaveda
as explicit musical score.
The structural identity confirmed
from the Vedic direction.

**dead_language_resurrection.md**
(this folder)
The physical derivation approach
as general methodology. Six evidence
streams. Convergence criterion.
Śikṣā as internal validation.
VS-specific architecture note.

**VS_phoneme_inventory.md**
The master reference for this project.
All phoneme parameters, synthesis
architecture, diagnostic thresholds,
and verification status.

## THE ŚIKṢĀ INTERFACE

The Śikṣā treatises classify every
Sanskrit phoneme by articulatory
position. The taxonomy maps directly
to formant targets.

```
ŚIKṢĀ TAXONOMY → ACOUSTIC TARGETS

Kaṇṭhya   (velar / guttural)
  Phonemes: k kh g gh ṅ h a ā
  F2 locus at velar constriction
  ~2000–2600 Hz at burst
  Includes the open vowel [a] —
  the vocal tract maximally open
  at the guttural position

Tālavya   (palatal)
  Phonemes: c ch j jh ñ ś e ai
  F2 locus at palatal constriction
  ~2600–3200 Hz at burst
  Higher F2 than velar

Mūrdhanya (retroflex / cerebral)
  Phonemes: ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ ṣ ṛ ṝ ḷ
  F2 locus LOW ~1200–1500 Hz
  F3 DEPRESSED below neutral
  The mūrdhanya marker:
  tongue tip retroflexed,
  F3 < 2500 Hz
  New Tonnetz territory —
  not present in European languages

Dantya    (dental)
  Phonemes: t th d dh n s l
  F2 locus at alveolar/dental
  ~1700–2100 Hz
  Standard dental/alveolar position

Oṣṭhya    (labial)
  Phonemes: p ph b bh m u ū
  F2 locus at bilabial constriction
  ~800–1200 Hz
  Labial position — back F2
```

Every phoneme entry in
VS_phoneme_inventory.md includes
its Śikṣā classification.
Every diagnostic checks the
Śikṣā-predicted acoustic target.
Agreement between the acoustic
measurement and the Śikṣā
prediction is the primary
confirmation criterion.

## THE SYNTHESIS ENGINE

This project uses `voice_physics_vs.py`.

This engine is VS-specific.
It implements the universal
source-filter physics — Rosenberg
pulse, formant resonator bank,
room model — but it is not
imported from or dependent on
any other project's code.

Architecture extensions specific
to VS:

**Retroflex F3 dip model.**
The iir_notch function applied
to F3 for all mūrdhanya phonemes.
The notch depth and bandwidth
parameterised per phoneme.
The F3 dip is the diagnostic
signature of the retroflex class.

**Aspirated stop architecture.**
Three-phase synthesis extended
to four phases for aspirated stops:
closure / burst / aspiration noise /
voiced release. The aspiration
noise phase is the phonemically
distinctive feature. OE had no
aspirated stops. This is new
synthesis territory.

**Pitch accent F0 modulation.**
The udātta/anudātta/svarita system
implemented as F0 arc over the
syllable. udātta: F0 +20–40 Hz
above baseline. anudātta: F0
at baseline. svarita: F0 falls
continuously through syllable
duration from udātta to anudātta.

**Anusvāra and visarga.**
Anusvāra: nasal resonance
applied to preceding vowel
without full oral closure.
Visarga: voiceless h-like
release at phrase boundary.
Both require new synthesis paths.

## THE DIAGNOSTIC LOOP

Every word in this reconstruction
follows the same loop:

```
1. TRANSCRIBE
   Write the Sanskrit word in IPA.
   Classify each phoneme by
   Śikṣā category.
   Identify formant targets from
   VS_phoneme_inventory.md.
   Write syllabified phoneme list
   with pitch accent marked.

2. SYNTHESIZE
   Add word to voice_physics_vs.py.
   Run synthesis.
   Produce dry, hall, and 4× slow.

3. DIAGNOSE
   Run the diagnostic script.
   Check all levels:
     Level 1: acoustic identity
              (voicing, formants, duration)
     Level 2: Śikṣā confirmation
              (does the acoustic output
               match the Śikṣā-predicted
               articulatory position?)
     Level 3: qualia coherence
              (does it sound like the
               correct room in the
               vocal topology?)

4. LISTEN
   The ear is the final arbiter.
   Numbers support the ear.
   The ear does not serve the numbers.

5. VERIFY
   When it passes the diagnostic
   AND sounds correct:
   Add to VS verified word reference.
   Update VS_phoneme_inventory.md.
   Never re-derive a verified phoneme.

6. DOCUMENT
   Write evidence.md for the word.
   Include all diagnostic values.
   Include Śikṣā confirmation status.
   Include iteration record.
```

## THE PITCH ACCENT SYSTEM

The Vedic pitch accent is three-valued:

```
UDĀTTA    — raised    — high pitch
ANUDĀTTA  — unraised  — low pitch
SVARITA   — resultant — falling glide

SYNTHESIS MAPPING:

Udātta:
  F0 = pitch_hz × 1.20 to 1.35
  Duration +10% of syllable length
  Ghost after: longer than anudātta
  (greater coherence distance to return)

Anudātta:
  F0 = pitch_hz (baseline)
  Duration standard
  Ghost after: minimal
  (already near H)

Svarita:
  F0 starts at udātta level
  F0 falls continuously to anudātta
  through the syllable duration
  The fall IS the content
  The ghost is present within
  the syllable in real time
```
