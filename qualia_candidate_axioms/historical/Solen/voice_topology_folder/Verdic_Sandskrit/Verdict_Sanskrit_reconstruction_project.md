# THE VEDIC SANSKRIT RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
## A Reasoning Artifact on the First
## Principles-Based Acoustic Reconstruction
## of Rigvedic Performance
## February 2026

---

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

This is the first attempt in history
to reconstruct the acoustic performance
of Rigvedic Sanskrit from physical
first principles.

Not from a modern scholar approximating
Vedic phonemes from a textbook.
Not from statistical models trained
on modern Hindi or Bengali.
Not from expert intuition about
how the language sounded.

From the physics of the human vocal tract.
From the topology of the resonant space
that vocal tract inhabits.
From the Śikṣā treatises — the ancient
Indian phonetic science that independently
derived the same vocal tract topology
from the same anatomical instrument,
arriving at the same five dimensions,
approximately 2,500 years ago.
From living Vedic reciters who have
maintained acoustic continuity for
3,000–3,500 years without interruption.
From a self-referential measurement loop
that confirms every phoneme target
before the ear is asked to judge.

The result is auditable.
Every parameter has a physical basis.
Every target is verifiable.
Every reconstruction step is
reproducible from the repository alone.

## WHY THIS LANGUAGE

The Beowulf reconstruction demonstrated
the methodology.
The Vedic Sanskrit reconstruction
is the methodology's most powerful
validation — and its most important
extension.

Three reasons.

**Reason 1: Independent confirmation.**
The Śikṣā treatises are a second,
independent physical derivation
of the vocal tract topology.
Same instrument. Same five dimensions.
Same attractor basins for the phonemes.
Different civilisation. Different century.
Different starting premise.
The convergence of the OE reconstruction
with the Śikṣā system is the strongest
possible evidence that the structure
being described is real.

**Reason 2: Living verification source.**
The Vedic recitation tradition has
maintained acoustic continuity for
approximately 3,500 years.
Living Brahmin reciters perform the
Rigveda today with pitch accent intact
— udātta, anudātta, svarita — exactly
as prescribed by the ancient treatises.
A physics-derived reconstruction that
matches this living tradition is not
merely historically plausible.
It is acoustically confirmed.
Cross-verification against a living
tradition is impossible for any
other language on the target list.

**Reason 3: The Samaveda is already a score.**
The Beowulf insight — that the
alliterative metre is acoustic
engineering, that the poem was composed
to sound optimal in performance —
has a 3,500-year-old Indian parallel
that never hid what it was.
The Samaveda declared openly:
this text is sung.
The pitch contours are notated.
The melodic patterns are prescribed.
The arc types are named.
What the Beowulf reconstruction had
to discover from the physics, the
Vedic tradition stated as axiom.
The Samaveda is the most explicit
instantiation of the language-is-music
claim in recorded human history.

## WHAT WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE
## THIS PROJECT BEGAN

The following artifacts constitute
the theoretical and technical foundation.
This project does not re-derive them.
It applies and extends them.

### THE ŚIKṢĀ INTERFACE

The Śikṣā treatises are an independent
physical derivation of the vocal
topology. They must be read as such.

Key documents:
- Pāṇinīya Śikṣā
- Yājñavalkya Śikṣā
- Nāradīya Śikṣā
- Māṇḍukī Śikṣā

What they describe:

```
ŚIKṢĀ TAXONOMY:

  Kaṇṭhya     (guttural)
    = velar constriction
    = [k, kh, g, gh, ṅ, h, a, ā]
    = high F2 closure → low F2 burst
    = H-proximal in constriction dimension

  Tālavya     (palatal)
    = palatal constriction
    = [c, ch, j, jh, ñ, ś, e, ai]
    = high F2, palatal burst

  Mūrdhanya   (cerebral / retroflex)
    = retroflex constriction
    = [ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ, ṣ, ṛ, ṝ]
    = LOW F2 locus ~1200-1400 Hz
    = F3 sharp dip
    = the new Tonnetz dimension

  Dantya      (dental)
    = dental constriction
    = [t, th, d, dh, n, s, l]
    = alveolar locus ~1800-2000 Hz

  Oṣṭhya      (labial)
    = labial constriction
    = [p, ph, b, bh, m, u, ū]
    = bilabial locus ~1000-1200 Hz
```

The Śikṣā taxonomy maps directly
to the five places of articulation
used in the VS_phoneme_inventory.
Every Śikṣā category has a
corresponding Tonnetz position.
The treatise authors were mapping
the acoustic phonological space
from the inside — from the experience
of producing the sounds in a
trained vocal instrument — rather
than from the outside measurement
instruments we use.
They arrived at the same space.

## THE PROOF OF CONCEPT WORD

**ṚG — the first syllable of Rigveda**

Chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Contains the syllabic ṛ** —
   the vowel-that-is-also-r.
   [ɻ̩] retroflex syllabic approximant.
   F1 ~400 Hz, F2 ~1200-1400 Hz.
   A position in the vocal topology
   that has never been mapped in this
   framework.
   The retroflex dimension —
   mūrdhanya — opens here.

2. **Contains the voiced velar stop g**
   in a new phonological context —
   word-final, following syllabic vowel.
   [g] is in the OE inventory.
   Its behaviour after [ṛ] is not.
   Coarticulation target: F2 locus
   ~2500 Hz rising from [ṛ]'s low F2.

3. **Is the name of the text.**
   The first sound of the oldest
   continuously transmitted poem.
   The proof of concept should be
   the root of the thing being proved.

4. **Maximum information density.**
   Two phonemes.
   One completely new (syllabic ṛ).
   One previously mapped ([g]).
   One new coarticulation transition.
   Retroflex → velar.
   The geometry of this transition
   through the vocal topology is
   the first map of this territory.

**Expected diagnostic structure:**

```
D1   Ṛ syllabic retroflex       [ɻ̩]
     F1 centroid 350-500 Hz
     F2 centroid 1100-1500 Hz    ← lower than [ə]
     F3 DIPS — retroflexion marker
     Voicing >= 0.50
     Duration: vowel-length (50-80 ms)

D2   G voiced velar stop        [g]
     LF ratio closure >= 0.40   ← use LF ratio
     Burst centroid ~2500 Hz
     F2 rises from ṛ locus

D3   Full syllable
     Duration 120-160 ms
     Voicing profile: sustained → stop

D4   Perceptual
     LISTEN: the curl of the tongue.
     Not English r. Not a vowel.
     Both. Neither.
     The retroflex is a new room
     in the vocal topology.
     This is the first time
     we enter it.
```

## THE VEDIC PROJECT SCOPE

### PHASE 0: FOUNDATIONS
- VS_phoneme_inventory.md (this project's OE_phoneme_inventory.md equivalent)
- Śikṣā interface documented
- Pitch accent → arc type mapping
- Proof of concept: ṚG

### PHASE 1: THE OPENING VERSE
Rigveda Book 1, Hymn 1, Verse 1.

```
agnimīḷe purohitaṃ
yajñasya devamṛtvijam
hotāraṃ ratnadhātamam
```

*I praise Agni, the household priest,
the divine minister of the sacrifice,
the invoker, greatest bestower of treasure.*

The first verse of the first hymn
of the oldest surviving Indo-European
poem. Approximately 12 words.
The opening of the Rigveda.
Analogous in scope to Beowulf line 1.

**New phoneme contexts in this verse:**

- [ɻ̩] syllabic retroflex ṛ — in ṛtvijam
- [ṭ] retroflex stop — in ratna
- [ṇ] retroflex nasal — in hotāraṃ
- [ɲ] palatal nasal — in yajña
- [ɕ] palatal sibilant ś — present throughout
- [ʂ] retroflex sibilant ṣ — in yajñasya
- Aspirated stops [gʰ], [dʰ] — in devam, dhātamam
- Pitch accent — udātta/anudātta/svarita
  on every word

**Performance parameters:**

```
pitch_hz:        120.0
  (Vedic recitation — male voice,
   chest register, ritual context)

dil:             2.0-3.0
  (deliberate ritual recitation,
   slower than conversational,
   faster than maximum extension)

arc_type:        ARC_WEIGHT
  (the reciter carries the mantra
   and delivers it to the fire,
   to the deity, to the space)

rt60:            1.5
  (outdoor ritual or temple courtyard,
   less reverberant than mead hall,
   different acoustic environment)

direct_ratio:    0.55
  (more direct signal than mead hall —
   open air or smaller stone space)
```

### PHASE 2: THE AGNI HYMNS
Rigveda Book 1, Hymns 1-10.
The Agni sequence.
The opening of the complete text.
Approximately 100 verses.

### PHASE 3: REPRESENTATIVE SELECTION
One hymn from each of the 10 Books.
Full coverage of the phonological
and prosodic range of the Rigveda.

### PHASE 4: THE SAMAVEDA INTERFACE
The same verses set to the Samavedic
melodic patterns.
The same phoneme inventory,
the same formant targets,
but with explicit F0 arcs derived
from the musical notation rather
than from prose prosody.
The most explicit language-is-music
demonstration in the project.

## THE PITCH ACCENT SYSTEM
## AS ARC TYPE MAPPING

The Vedic pitch accent is three-valued:

```
UDĀTTA    (उदात्त)  — raised — high pitch
ANUDĀTTA  (अनुदात्त) — not raised — low pitch
SVARITA   (स्वरित)  — resultant — falling glide

MAPPING TO ARC TYPES:

Udātta    = maximum departure from baseline
          = the peak of the coherence space
            excursion
          = ARC_EUREKA at syllable level:
            rapid departure, held at peak,
            maximum gap sustained

Anudātta  = return toward H
          = low coherence distance from baseline
          = the tonic / origin position
          = the syllable version of H itself

Svarita   = falling from udātta toward anudātta
          = the descent arc
          = ARC_WEIGHT at syllable level:
            carrying something from the peak
            back down to rest
          = the most common of the three —
            the dominant motion of Vedic prosody

ACOUSTIC CONSEQUENCE:

  A verse in udātta:
    F0 rises ~20-40 Hz above baseline
    Duration of high-pitched syllable
    slightly longer than anudātta
    Ghost after udātta syllable:
    longer — more distance to return to H

  A verse in anudātta:
    F0 at or below baseline
    Minimal ghost — already at H
    Maximum coherence position

  A svarita syllable:
    F0 begins at udātta height,
    falls through the syllable duration
    to anudātta level
    Continuous F0 arc — not a step
    The glide IS the content
    The ghost is already present
    within the syllable — the descent
    toward H happening in real time
```

The Vedic reciter was navigating
the coherence space three times
per syllable, explicitly, with
named positions and trained precision.

The Tonnetz bridge document described
this in abstract terms.
The Vedic tradition named it
in human terms 3,000 years ago.

These are the same description.

## WHAT THIS PROJECT ADDS TO
## THE FRAMEWORK

The Beowulf reconstruction mapped
the standard five-place consonant
inventory used by most European
languages:
  bilabial, alveolar, velar,
  dental fricatives, glottal.

The Vedic Sanskrit reconstruction
maps three new territories:

**1. The retroflex dimension.**
The tongue curled back against
the post-alveolar palate.
A sixth constriction place.
A new axis in the vocal topology.
The mūrdhanya series:
  [ʈ, ʈʰ, ɖ, ɖʰ, ɳ, ʂ, ɻ̩]
These are positions in the
acoustic phonological space
that no European language uses
and that the OE framework
never needed to map.
They now become part of the
universal inventory.

**2. Aspiration as a phonological dimension.**
The breathy burst after a stop.
A phoneme parameter that
OE did not use phonemically
(OE [p] vs [b] = voicing only,
no aspirated stops).
Sanskrit has 10 aspirated phonemes.
Aspiration is its own Tonnetz axis —
the turbulent-breath dimension —
orthogonal to voicing and place.
The framework gains this dimension
for the first time.

**3. Syllabic sonorants.**
The vowel-r [ṛ] and vowel-l [ḷ].
Sounds that function as vowels
but are produced with lateral
or rhotic articulation.
These occupy positions in the
vowel space that no OE phoneme
occupied — low F2, mid F1,
with rhotic coloring lowering F3.
The vowel space gains
its rhotic sector.

**When these three dimensions are mapped,
the vocal topology framework
becomes sufficient for the
majority of the world's
phonological inventories.**

OE covered the European sector.
Vedic Sanskrit covers the
South Asian and retroflex sector.
Together they cover the space
that PIE occupied —
and PIE is the ancestor of
both traditions.
