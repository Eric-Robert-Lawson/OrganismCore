# THE PHYSICAL DERIVATION APPROACH
## Reasoning Artifact — Dead Language Reconstruction
### From Vocal Tract Topology and Acoustic Physics
**February 2026**

---

## PREAMBLE

This document describes a methodology
for reconstructing dead languages that
differs in its foundational assumptions
from the standard comparative-historical
approach. It does not replace that
approach. It operates alongside it,
constraining it from below — from the
physics of the instrument rather than
from the history of the record.

The methodology is stated here in
general terms so that it can be applied
to any dead language for which a
phonological reconstruction is attempted.
It is not specific to any one language.
It derives from the physics of the
instrument — the human vocal tract —
which is the same instrument in every
language, in every century, in every
culture.

---

## I. THE FUNDAMENTAL CLAIM

**The human vocal tract is a physical
instrument. Its topology is fixed by
anatomy. Its acoustic consequences are
fixed by physics. Neither topology nor
physics is culturally determined.**

This means there exists a space —
call it the **acoustic phonological
space** — of all sounds that the human
vocal tract can produce and that the
human auditory system can receive and
distinguish. This space is universal.
It is the same space for a speaker
in 8th century Mercia, a Vedic reciter
in 1500 BCE, and a speaker today.
It was the same space 50,000 years
ago when language first emerged.
It will be the same space 50,000 years
from now.

Languages are **paths through this
space**. Different languages take
different paths. The paths are shaped
by history, contact, accident, and
drift. But the space itself is not.

A dead language is a path through
this space that is no longer actively
walked. The path can be approached
from two directions:

1. **From the record** — written
   documents, comparative linguistics,
   descendant languages, loanwords,
   rhyme and metre patterns. This is
   the standard historical approach.
   It works downward from the surface
   evidence toward the sounds.

2. **From the physics** — vocal tract
   topology, acoustic resonance theory,
   auditory system architecture, the
   harmonic series, the principles of
   maximum distinctiveness and optimal
   acoustic coverage. This is the
   physical derivation approach.
   It works upward from the instrument
   toward the sounds.

**Where these two approaches converge,
the reconstruction is maximally
trustworthy. Where they diverge, each
constrains the other.**

---

## II. THE VOCAL TRACT AS INSTRUMENT

The vocal tract is a tube
approximately 17 cm long in an adult,
running from the glottis to the lips,
with a side branch at the velum
opening to the nasal cavity.

Its acoustic behaviour is determined
by:

- **Source:** Airflow from the lungs,
  modulated by the vocal folds
  (voiced) or unmodulated (voiceless)
- **Filter:** The resonant cavity
  shaped by tongue, lips, velum,
  and jaw position
- **Radiation:** The output at lips
  and/or nostrils

This is the **source-filter model**
of speech production. It is not a
metaphor. It is a physical description
of what happens when a human speaks.

The resonant frequencies of the filter
— the **formants** — are determined
entirely by the geometry of the cavity.
F1 correlates with jaw opening and
tongue height. F2 correlates with
tongue frontness/backness. F3 and
above carry secondary information
about lip rounding, pharyngeal
constriction, retroflex position,
and other fine details.

**These relationships are physical
laws, not linguistic conventions.**

A vowel produced with a specific
tongue and jaw configuration will
have specific formant frequencies
regardless of what language the
speaker is using, what century they
live in, or what culture they belong
to. The physics does not know about
languages. It only knows about
cavity geometry.

---

## III. THE ACOUSTIC PHONOLOGICAL SPACE

Plot all possible vowels in a
two-dimensional space with F1 on
the vertical axis (inverted — high
F1 at bottom, low F1 at top) and
F2 on the horizontal axis (reversed
— high F2 at left, low F2 at right).

This is the **vowel space**. Its
shape is determined by the limits
of vocal tract deformation — how
far the tongue can move, how wide
the jaw can open, how much the lips
can round. These limits are anatomical.
They are the same for all humans.

Natural languages do not fill this
space randomly. They tend to:

1. **Use the periphery** — vowels
   cluster near the edges of the
   possible space, maximising
   acoustic distance between them.
   This is the principle of
   **maximum distinctiveness**.

2. **Cover the space evenly** —
   vowels are spread so that no
   large region of the space is
   empty. This maximises the
   information-carrying capacity
   of the vowel inventory.

3. **Prefer stable positions** —
   vowels avoid regions where small
   articulatory errors cause large
   acoustic changes. This is the
   principle of **production
   stability**.

These tendencies are not rules that
linguists invented. They are
consequences of the physics and of
the evolutionary pressure to
communicate reliably. Languages
that violated them would be harder
to learn, harder to produce
consistently, and harder to
understand in noise. They would
be selected against.

**A fully-functional dead language
used by competent speakers over
centuries was a near-optimal
solution to these constraints.**

This means the phoneme inventory
of any mature dead language can be
expected to occupy near-optimal
positions in the acoustic
phonological space — not because
we know the history, but because
that is where functional languages
live. The physics predicts it.

## IV. THE TONNETZ AND PROSODIC STRUCTURE

The **Tonnetz** is a two-dimensional
lattice representation of harmonic
relationships. In music theory, it
maps the relationships between
pitches according to their interval
ratios — fifths in one direction,
thirds in another.

Its relevance to language is this:

The human auditory system is
exquisitely sensitive to harmonic
ratios. The cochlea performs a
Fourier decomposition of incoming
sound. The neural architecture for
pitch perception is tuned to detect
harmonic series relationships.
These are not cultural preferences.
They are consequences of how the
auditory system processes vibration.

**Language that uses the harmonic
series well is language that the
auditory system receives with
minimum processing cost.**

Tonal languages make this explicit —
pitch is phonemic, and tonal
inventories tend to use harmonically
coherent pitch intervals. But all
languages use it implicitly in
prosody. Stress, intonation,
and rhythm all ride on pitch
modulation.

Vedic Sanskrit makes this explicit
in a way unique in recorded history.
The pitch accent system —
udātta, anudātta, svarita —
is a three-value system that maps
directly onto the Tonnetz coherence
gradient: departure from H, return
toward H, and the glide between.
The Samaveda notates the melodic
contours of Vedic recitation
explicitly, confirming that the
language was designed to be sung,
not merely spoken. This is the
most explicit ancient confirmation
of the language-is-music claim.

**The acoustic optimisation of Vedic
recitation is not incidental.
It is the substance of the art.
The Vedic tradition knew this
and said so directly.**

---

## V. THE CONVERGENCE HYPOTHESIS

Given the above, the following
can be stated:

**If a phonological reconstruction
is approached simultaneously from
the historical record (top-down)
and from the physics of the
instrument (bottom-up), and if
the two approaches converge on
the same set of phoneme parameters,
then the reconstruction is not
merely historically plausible —
it is physically inevitable.**

The sounds are not where they are
because scholars assigned them
there. They are where they are
because the vocal tract produces
them there, the auditory system
receives them there, and the
physics of resonant cavities
puts them there.

For Vedic Sanskrit, there is a
third convergence stream available
to no other dead language project:
the Śikṣā treatises. These are
ancient Indian phonetic science
documents that independently derived
the same vocal tract topology —
the same five articulatory dimensions,
the same attractor basins — from
the inside, from the proprioceptive
experience of trained reciters,
approximately 2,500 years ago.

**Where the physics-derived reconstruction,
the historical record, and the Śikṣā
treatises all converge, the reconstruction
is triply confirmed.**

---

## VI. THE BEAUTY CRITERION

This is the part that cannot be
fully formalised but is not
therefore dismissible.

There is a class of language
sounds that are — not by cultural
convention but by physical
necessity — easier to produce,
more stable under noise, more
coherent to the auditory system,
and more efficiently organised
in the acoustic space. A language
that uses these sounds, in a
phoneme inventory that covers the
acoustic space well, with prosody
that rides the harmonic series,
is a language that sounds
**beautiful** to any human ear.

Not because beauty is objective
in a metaphysical sense. But
because the auditory system has
specific preferences that are
consequences of its physical
architecture. Sounds that are
processed with minimum cost
are experienced as more pleasant.
Harmonic relationships that
the cochlea resolves easily
are experienced as more consonant.
Rhythms that match the
oscillatory patterns of the
auditory brainstem are experienced
as more engaging.

**A dead language reconstructed
from the physics of the instrument
will tend toward beauty — not
because the reconstructor aimed
for beauty, but because the
physics and the auditory system
jointly define a region of the
acoustic space that is both
optimal and beautiful.**

Vedic Sanskrit, with its
precisely documented pitch accent,
its five-place consonant system
covering the full articulatory
range of the vocal tract, and
its tradition of oral performance
maintained for 3,500 years,
is the strongest available evidence
that this prediction is correct.
The tradition survived because
it sounds right. The physics
explains why.

---

## VII. THE QUALIA LINK

Language is not only acoustic
signal. It is experience.

There is something it is like
to speak a language. The
proprioceptive experience of
the tongue and jaw moving to
specific positions. The
kinaesthetic sense of airflow
and voicing. The auditory
experience of hearing your own
voice shaped by your own
resonant cavity.

These experiences are not
arbitrary. They are consequences
of the physical configurations
of the vocal tract. And they
are shared — any human producing
the same vocal tract configuration
has the same proprioceptive
experience.

The retroflex consonants of
Vedic Sanskrit — the mūrdhanya
class — produce a distinctive
proprioceptive experience: the
tongue tip curled back, the
resonant cavity reshaped,
the F3 depressed. This experience
is recoverable. The configuration
still exists in the instrument.
Any speaker who produces the
retroflex position experiences
what a Vedic reciter experienced.
The qualia are not locked in
history. They are locked in the
physics of the tube.

**The language is not dead in
the body. It is only absent
from use. The instrument still
exists. The configurations are
still possible. The physics has
not changed.**

---

## VIII. THE ŚIKṢĀ AS INTERNAL
## VALIDATION SYSTEM

The Vedic Sanskrit reconstruction
has a unique resource: the Śikṣā
treatises provide an independent
internal validation system derived
from within the tradition itself.

The Śikṣā classified every Sanskrit
phoneme by its place and manner of
articulation — kaṇṭhya (guttural/velar),
tālavya (palatal), mūrdhanya (retroflex),
dantya (dental), oṣṭhya (labial) —
and prescribed precise articulatory
configurations for each.

These classifications map directly
to formant targets in the acoustic
space. The Śikṣā authors were
describing the same physical
positions that acoustic measurement
confirms. They arrived at the
five-dimensional vocal topology
from the inside — from practice —
rather than from outside measurement.

**This is an independent derivation
of the same structure. The convergence
is not coincidence. It is the physics,
described twice, from different
directions, by different cultures,
separated by centuries.**

The Śikṣā is used in this project
as a primary evidence stream —
not as a secondary source, not
as corroboration. It is an
independent physical derivation.
Where the acoustic measurement
and the Śikṣā agree, the
reconstruction is confirmed.
Where they diverge, the divergence
is investigated.

---

## IX. EPISTEMOLOGICAL STATUS

The physical derivation approach
produces claims with the following
epistemological structure:

**Strong claims** — fully
determined by physics and anatomy:

- The formant frequencies of a
  given vocal tract configuration
  are what they are. They are
  calculable from cavity geometry.
  If the reconstruction specifies
  a configuration, the acoustic
  output is determinate.

- The limits of the acoustic
  phonological space are fixed
  by anatomy. No language can
  use sounds outside this space.

- The principles of maximum
  distinctiveness and production
  stability are consequences of
  physics and evolutionary pressure.
  Any mature language will
  approximate them.

**Medium claims** — strongly
supported but not fully determined:

- A mature literary language
  with a sophisticated recitation
  tradition was a near-optimal
  solution in the acoustic space.

- The prosodic structures of
  Vedic recitation were optimised
  for acoustic coherence in
  performance.

- The convergence of the physical
  derivation, the historical record,
  and the Śikṣā treatises indicates
  the reconstruction is in the
  correct region of the acoustic
  space.

**Weak claims** — plausible but
not formally derivable:

- The exact parameter values
  for individual phonemes match
  what historical speakers produced.

- The reconstruction would be
  immediately intelligible to
  a Vedic speaker without
  accommodation.

- The regional and temporal
  variation within Vedic Sanskrit
  is accurately captured.

**The weak claims are where
the historical and Śikṣā evidence
is indispensable. The strong
and medium claims are where
the physical derivation approach
provides independent evidence.**

## X. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
### For the Vedic Sanskrit reconstruction

1. **Build the synthesiser from
   physics first.** Implement the
   source-filter model. Derive
   formant targets from vocal
   tract geometry and Śikṣā
   classification. Not from
   transcriptions of modern
   Hindi or Sanskrit textbooks.

2. **Use the Śikṣā as a primary
   evidence stream.** Every phoneme
   has a Śikṣā classification.
   Every Śikṣā classification has
   a corresponding acoustic target.
   The mapping is in
   VS_phoneme_inventory.md.

3. **Use the acoustic space as
   a constraint.** If a proposed
   phoneme inventory clusters
   phonemes too close together
   in F1/F2 space, the inventory
   is suspicious regardless of
   what the historical record says.

4. **Verify from the instrument,
   not just from the record.**
   A phoneme that passes acoustic
   diagnostics — voicing, formant
   placement, spectral shape,
   antiresonance — is more
   trustworthy than one that
   only matches a transcription
   convention.

5. **Take the beauty criterion
   seriously.** If the reconstruction
   sounds harsh, cluttered, or
   uncomfortable to produce,
   something is probably wrong.
   A tradition maintained for
   3,500 years by trained reciters
   does not sound that way.

6. **Apply the Tonnetz to
   prosody.** The pitch accent
   system — udātta, anudātta,
   svarita — maps directly to
   Tonnetz arc types. The mapping
   is documented in
   Vedic_Tonnetz_Bridge.md.
   Every word has an accent pattern.
   Every accent pattern has an
   arc type. Implement both.

7. **Preserve the qualia link.**
   The reconstruction should
   specify not just acoustic
   output but articulatory
   configuration — the actual
   physical positions of tongue,
   lips, jaw, velum, tongue tip
   (retroflex or not). These are
   the embodied memory of the
   language. They are recoverable.
   They should be recovered.

8. **Verify against living reciters.**
   The Vedic recitation tradition
   is alive. Acoustic measurement
   of living Brahmin reciters
   performing the Rigveda provides
   a ground truth unavailable for
   any other ancient language.
   Where the reconstruction matches
   the living tradition, it is
   confirmed. Where it diverges,
   the divergence must be explained.

---

## XI. THE CORE STATEMENT

**A dead language reconstructed
from the physics of the instrument
is not an approximation of what
was. It is a derivation of what
must have been — given the
anatomy, the physics, the
auditory architecture, and the
evolutionary pressures that shape
all human language.**

The historical record tells us
where to look in the acoustic
space. The Śikṣā tells us what
the trained ear heard from the
inside. The physics tells us what
is there. The auditory system
tells us what is coherent. The
recitation tradition tells us
what 3,500 years of performance
practice converged upon.

These five constraints together
define a region of possibility.
The reconstruction lives in
that region. Whether it lands
at exactly the right point
within that region — that is
the remaining uncertainty.

But the region itself is not
uncertain. The instrument has
not changed. The space has not
changed. The physics has not
changed.

**The sounds were always there.
The language is being found,
not invented.**

## ARCHITECTURE NOTE

This project is built on the
universal vocal topology substrate.
It does not depend on any other
language reconstruction project.
It does not inherit parameters
from Old English or any other
language. It derives every phoneme
target from:

1. The physics of the vocal tract
2. The Śikṣā treatises
3. The historical orthographic record
4. Comparative Indo-European evidence
5. Acoustic measurement of living
   cognate languages and living
   Vedic reciters
6. Perceptual validation

Where a phoneme target matches a
target independently verified in
another language project — for
example, velar stop [g] — this is
recorded as **convergence evidence
for the universal topology**, not
as a dependency. The same physics
produces the same result in any
language. The agreement is the point.

The synthesis engine —
`voice_physics_vs.py` — is
VS-specific. It shares architectural
patterns with other reconstruction
engines because those patterns
implement universal physics.
It does not import from them.
