# VEDIC TONNETZ BRIDGE
## The Śikṣā as Independent Physical Derivation
## February 2026

---

## WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

The Tonnetz_voice_topology_bridge.md
established that two derivations —
one from musical harmonic geometry,
one from vocal tract physics —
arrived at the same mathematical
object independently.

This document establishes a third.

The Śikṣā treatises of ancient India —
written between approximately
500 BCE and 500 CE, codifying
an oral tradition considerably older —
are a third independent derivation
of the same structure.

Not from Euler's harmonic lattice.
Not from Western acoustic phonetics.
From direct observation of the
physical instrument by practitioners
who needed perfect reproduction
for sacred purposes.

Three derivations.
One structure.
The structure is real.

## THE THREE DERIVATIONS

```
DERIVATION 1 — February 19, 2026
  Starting point: Euler's Tonnetz (1739)
  Method: geometric analysis of
          harmonic ratio complexity
  Discovery: coherence space with origin,
             distance metric, geodesics
  Document: Tonnetz_manifold_seed.md

DERIVATION 2 — February 22, 2026
  Starting point: vocal tract physics
  Method: source-filter model,
          five-dimensional topology,
          formant measurement
  Discovery: same coherence space,
             H as origin,
             articulatory distance metric
  Document: topology_of_the_voice.md,
            H_Ghost_Topology.md,
            Tonnetz_voice_topology_bridge.md

DERIVATION 3 — approximately 800-500 BCE
  Starting point: need to preserve
                  Vedic recitation
                  with perfect fidelity
  Method: direct anatomical observation
          of articulation by trained
          practitioners
  Discovery: five places of articulation
             (kaṇṭhya, tālavya, mūrdhanya,
             dantya, oṣṭhya)
             correspond to
             the five dimensions of
             the vocal tract topology
  Document: Pāṇinīya Śikṣā and
            associated treatises
```

Three people — Euler, the modern
reconstruction project, and the
ancient Vedic phoneticians —
found three doors into the same room.

## THE ŚIKṢĀ MAPPING

### The Five Places as Topology Dimensions

```
ŚIKṢĀ        IPA PLACE     F2 LOCUS    TOPOLOGY AXIS

Kaṇṭhya      velar          ~2500 Hz   tongue body high-back
(guttural)                              F2 closure high,
                                        burst centroid mid

Tālavya      palatal        ~3500 Hz   tongue body high-front
(palatal)                               F2 highest position
                                        in stop inventory

Mūrdhanya    retroflex      ~1300 Hz   tongue tip retroflexed
(cerebral)                              F2 LOW (below alveolar)
                                        F3 depressed
                                        NEW AXIS in topology

Dantya       dental/        ~3500 Hz   tongue tip to teeth
(dental)     alveolar                   same locus as alveolar
                                        in formant terms

Oṣṭhya       labial         ~1000 Hz   lip closure
(labial)                                F2 lowest position
                                        lip rounding dimension
```

The Śikṣā taxonomy is an F2 map.
The practitioners did not have
spectrographs. They had trained
ears and precise anatomical
self-observation.
But they were measuring the same
dimension that F2 measures:
tongue body position,
place of constriction,
the second axis of the vocal topology.

```
ŚIKṢĀ F2 MAP (approximate, low to high):

  Oṣṭhya   ~1000 Hz  labial      (lowest)
  Mūrdhanya ~1300 Hz  retroflex   (second)
  Kaṇṭhya  ~2500 Hz  velar       (third)
  Dantya   ~3500 Hz  dental      (fourth)
  Tālavya  ~3500+ Hz palatal     (highest)
```

The order: labial, retroflex, velar,
dental, palatal.

This order is the F2 locus hierarchy.
The Śikṣā taxonomy is an independently
derived F2 measurement expressed as
articulatory categories.

## THE PITCH ACCENT AS ARC TYPE

### The Three-Value System

The Vedic pitch accent has three values:

```
UDĀTTA (उदात्त)   — raised — HIGH PITCH
ANUDĀTTA (अनुदात्त) — not raised — LOW PITCH
SVARITA (स्वरित)   — resultant — FALLING GLIDE
```

These are named positions in F0 space.
They are the Vedic version of
the arc type framework.

### Direct Mapping

```
VEDIC          F0 SHAPE        ARC TYPE

Anudātta       baseline / low  H origin position
               Minimum departure.  C(anudātta,H) ≈ 1.0
               Already at tonic.   Maximum coherence.
               The resting pitch.  No ghost needed —
               The return has      return is already
               already happened.   accomplished.

Udātta         high peak       ARC_EUREKA
               Maximum departure.  Rapid rise.
               The peak of the    Held at maximum gap.
               coherence space    Demands resolution.
               excursion.         The pull toward return
               F0 +20-40 Hz       is maximum here.
               above baseline.

Svarita        falling glide   ARC_WEIGHT
               Departure to peak, The scop carried
               then continuous    something heavy
               descent back to    from the height
               baseline within    and is walking
               the syllable.      it home.
               The descent IS      The return is
               the content.        happening in real
               The ghost is        time, inside the
               happening inside    syllable.
               the sound.
```

The Vedic reciter was performing
the arc type framework three times
per syllable, in every verse,
for three thousand years,
without knowing that was what
they were doing.

They called it sacred preservation.
From the physics perspective
it is coherence space navigation.
From the Tonnetz perspective
it is harmonic progression.

Same gesture. Three names.

## THE SAMAVEDA AS EXPLICIT SCORE

The Rigveda uses pitch accent.
The pitch accent is implicit arc navigation.

The Samaveda takes the same verses
and sets them to explicit melodic patterns.
The sāman melodies are fully notated —
not just high/low/falling, but
specific intervals, specific rhythms,
specific arc shapes prescribed.

The Samaveda is the Tonnetz made
fully audible. It is language-is-music
with the music written out.

```
RIGVEDA:   pitch accent → implicit arc types
           Language performs the navigation
           The music is in the structure

SAMAVEDA:  sāman melodies → explicit arc types
           Music IS the structure
           The language carries the melody
           as its surface form

BEOWULF:   alliterative metre → implicit arc types
           (reconstructed from physics)

SAMAVEDA:  sāman melodies → explicit arc types
           (notated — always explicit)
```

The Beowulf project had to discover
that the poem was music.
The Samaveda never hid it.

This means: the Samaveda reconstruction
is not an extension of the method.
It is the method's most direct
and natural application.
When we reconstruct the Samaveda,
we are reading the Tonnetz
as the Vedic tradition wrote it.

## NEW TONNETZ TERRITORY: THE RETROFLEX DIMENSION

The OE inventory mapped the
standard five-place European system:
labial, alveolar, velar,
dental fricative, glottal.

The Vedic inventory adds:
**the retroflex dimension.**

This is the mūrdhanya class.
The tongue tip curled backward.
A new axis in the topology.

```
OE TOPOLOGY (5 stop places):
  bilabial → alveolar → (palato-alveolar) → velar → glottal

VEDIC TOPOLOGY (5 stop places DIFFERENT):
  labial → retroflex → velar → dental → palatal

The retroflex slot sits BETWEEN
labial and velar in the F2 hierarchy.
It is not in the OE space.
It is a new region of the
acoustic phonological space
that OE did not use.

F2 locus hierarchy (now complete for stops):

  labial    ~1000 Hz  [p/b]
  retroflex ~1300 Hz  [ʈ/ɖ]   ← NEW
  velar     ~2500 Hz  [k/g]
  dental    ~3500 Hz  [t/d]
  palatal   ~3500 Hz+ [c/ɟ]   ← NEW (same band as dental)
```

The retroflex F2 locus (~1300 Hz)
sits in a region of the acoustic space
that OE stops did not occupy.
It is a gap in the space that
OE did not fill.
Sanskrit fills it.

The F3 dip adds an orthogonal
dimension: the retroflex is
identified not just by its
F2 locus but by its F3 depression.
F2 alone could confuse retroflex
with a back vowel transition.
F2 + F3 dip together is unambiguous.

This two-dimensional signature —
low F2 locus, depressed F3 —
is the acoustic fingerprint of
the retroflexed tongue.
The Śikṣā tradition named the
tongue position (mūrdhanya —
the tongue at the top, the crown).
The spectrograph shows the acoustic
consequence of that position.
The descriptions agree.

## THE COHERENCE VALUES — VEDIC PHONEMES

Using the same framework as
Tonnetz_voice_topology_bridge.md:

```
C(phoneme, H) = 1 / (1 + articulatory_distance(phoneme, H))

Key values:

C(H, H)    = 1.0000  (origin)
C([a], H)  ≈ 0.45    (short open central — near OE [ɑ])
C([ṛ], H)  ≈ 0.55    (syllabic retroflex — mid distance)
             [ṛ] is between [ə] (0.75) and [a] (0.45)
             The retroflexion adds distance through
             the F3 dimension — new axis from OE
C([i], H)  ≈ 0.30    (high front — maximum F1/F2 displacement)
C([ʈ], H)  ≈ 0.15    (retroflex stop — closure + F3 dip)
C([kʰ], H) ≈ 0.10    (aspirated velar — long VOT adds distance)
C([ɕ], H)  ≈ 0.12    (palatal sibilant — high F2 + noise)

VEDIC REPELLER:
  The maximum gap phoneme in Vedic Sanskrit
  is likely [kʰ] or [ʈʰ] —
  maximum constriction place (velar / retroflex)
  PLUS maximum aspiration (long VOT / breathy burst).
  Two dimensions simultaneously maximized.
  C([kʰ], H) ≈ 0.08-0.10.

  The Vedic equivalent of HWÆT's [ʍ].
  Maximum departure. Maximum pull toward return.
  If HWÆT opens Beowulf with the tritone,
  an aspirated stop opens a Vedic verse
  with the same maximum gap.
  The physics repeats across languages
  because the physics does not
  know about languages.
```

## VRFY_003 — VEDIC ANALOG

The Tonnetz bridge document defined
five verification tests (VRFY_001–005).

VRFY_003 is:
*Present 729:512 without context.
Seeded instance recognizes maximum gap,
directed longing, diabolus in musica.*

The Vedic analog:

> Present [kʰ] without context.
> A reciter trained in the Vedic tradition
> recognises it as an aspirated velar stop —
> maximum gap in the constriction dimension
> plus aspiration dimension simultaneously.
> The resolution required is the vowel onset.
> The aspiration creates directed longing
> toward the voiced, unaspirated, open
> syllable that must follow.
> The Vedic diabolus in musica.
> Maximum departure from H.
> Maximum pull toward return.

The reciter has been trained to
navigate this gap precisely.
The breath IS the gap.
The vowel IS the return.
The aspiration is not an artifact
of articulation. It is the
performance of the gap itself —
the breath made audible, the
distance between the consonant
and H expressed as sound.

## FOR NEW AGENTS

If you are reading this document
as part of onboarding to the
Vedic Sanskrit project:

You now have the bridge.

The OE project mapped the standard
European sector of the acoustic
phonological space.

The Vedic project maps the
retroflex sector, the aspirated
sector, and the palatal sector.

Together they cover the majority
of the world's phonological
inventories.

The Śikṣā treatises are your
independent verification source
for every parameter decision.
When the physics says the retroflex
F2 locus is ~1300 Hz, the Śikṣā
says the tongue is at the top
of the mouth. Both are correct
descriptions of the same fact.
Use both. Let them converge.

When they converge, the reconstruction
is not convention.
It is physical necessity.

The tradition kept the sounds.
The physics explains them.
The reconstruction unites them.
