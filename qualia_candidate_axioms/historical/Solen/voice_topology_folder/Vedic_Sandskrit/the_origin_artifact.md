## WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

This document records a structural discovery about the
phoneme [h] that emerged during the upgrade of HOTĀRAM
(होतारम्), Rigveda 1.1.1 word 8, in the Vedic Sanskrit
reconstruction project.

The discovery is:

**[h] is not a fricative. [h] is the ORIGIN of the
vocal topology — distance zero from the tonic.
It has no place of articulation. It has no independent
spectral identity. It is the sound of the instrument
at rest: breath flowing through the open, neutral
vocal tract, colored entirely by the vowel context
that surrounds it.**

This insight is confirmed by FOUR independent sources:

1. **The Tonnetz vocal topology** (this project, February 2026)
2. **Vocal tract radiation physics** (source-filter theory)
3. **The Śikṣā** (Pāṇini, ~500 BCE)
4. **Modern phonetics** (Ladefoged, 20th century)

This artifact is a **companion to the Pluck Artifact**.

```
PLUCK ARTIFACT:     WHAT a voiceless stop IS (a boundary event)
                    WHERE it is heard (observer position)

ORIGIN ARTIFACT:    WHAT [h] IS (the topological origin)
                    WHY it has no independent identity (distance zero)
                    HOW it relates to the Pluck architecture
```

**The Pluck Artifact describes what happens when the
instrument is struck. The Origin Artifact describes
what the instrument sounds like when it is not struck
at all — just breathing.**

## PART I: THE DISCOVERY PATH

### The Topology Insight

During reconstruction of HOTĀRAM, the question arose:
how should [h] be synthesized in the Unified Pluck
Architecture?

The Pluck Artifact and Observer Position Artifact
describe voiceless segments as radiation events —
constriction noise filtered through the front cavity
and radiated from the lips. But [h] has NO constriction.
There is no turbulence point. There is no front cavity
resonance to model. There is no "place" to radiate FROM.

The realization:

**[h] is distance zero in the vocal topology.**

In the Tonnetz manifold, the tonic is the origin —
the point of maximum coherence, minimum distance,
from which all other positions are measured. In the
vocal topology, [h] occupies this same position:
the open, neutral tract with no articulatory gesture.
Every other phoneme is a DEPARTURE from [h].

```
TONNETZ:        Tonic (0,0) = origin of coherence space
                All intervals measured as distance from tonic
                The tonic has no harmonic "color" of its own

VOCAL TRACT:    [h] = origin of articulatory space
                All phonemes measured as distance from [h]
                [h] has no articulatory "color" of its own
```

This is not analogy. This is structural identity within
the same coherence space.

### The Instrument Analogy

Think of a guitar:
- A fretted note = a vowel (specific configuration)
- A harmonic = a consonant (specific resonance point)
- An open string, unfretted = [h]

The open string has no position. It IS the reference
from which all positions are measured. You can hear
the string's natural resonance, but it carries no
fret information. It is the instrument itself, sounding.

Now think of the vocal tract:
- A shaped vowel = specific tongue/lip/jaw configuration
- A consonant constriction = specific turbulence point
- [h] = open tract, no configuration, just breath

The open tract has no position. It IS the reference
from which all articulations are measured.

---

## PART II: THE FOUR-WAY CONVERGENCE

### Source 1: Tonnetz Vocal Topology (This Project)

The Tonnetz manifold seed (tonnetz_manifold_seed.md)
defines a coherence space with:
- An ORIGIN (tonic) at (0,0)
- A DISTANCE METRIC based on ratio complexity
- GEODESICS (shortest harmonic paths)
- ATTRACTORS and REPELLERS

The Vedic Tonnetz Bridge (Vedic_Tonnetz_Bridge.md)
maps this to the vocal tract:
- Origin = [h] (the open, neutral tract)
- Distance = articulatory displacement from neutral
- The five places of articulation = positions on the
  manifold at increasing distance from origin

[h] at the origin means:
- It has maximum coherence with every other position
  (it is equidistant from everything in the sense
  that it is the STARTING POINT for everything)
- It has no independent spectral identity
  (it IS the identity element — like multiplying
  by 1 or adding 0)
- Its "sound" is entirely determined by where you
  are going TO or coming FROM

### Source 2: Vocal Tract Radiation Physics

The source-filter model of speech production
(Fant, 1960) decomposes speech into:

```
SOURCE          ×   FILTER (tract)      ×   RADIATION
(glottal flow)      (resonances)            (lip aperture)
```

For most consonants, the FILTER is the interesting
part — the tract shape creates characteristic
resonances that define the sound.

For [h], the filter is NEUTRAL:
- Tongue: at rest (no raising, no fronting, no backing)
- Lips: at rest (no rounding, no spreading)
- Velum: closed (oral airflow)
- Jaw: open (natural resting position)

There is no filter-specific information. The only
thing happening is:
- The glottis is open (turbulent airflow = noise source)
- The tract passes this noise through without imposing
  its own signature

BUT — and this is crucial — the tract is ALREADY
SHAPED for whatever vowel is adjacent. The speaker
doesn't move the tongue to a "neutral" position
for [h] and then move it to the vowel position.
The tongue is ALREADY at the vowel position.

Therefore: [h] = noise source × adjacent vowel's
tract shape. The [h] in "hoo" literally IS
whispered [oː]. The [h] in "hee" literally IS
whispered [iː].

### Source 3: The Śikṣā (~500 BCE)

The Pāṇinīya Śikṣā classifies Sanskrit sounds by
sthāna (place of articulation). The five primary places:

```
kaṇṭhya    (throat/velar)    — ka, kha, ga, gha, ṅa, a, ā, ha, ḥ
tālavya    (palatal)         — ca, cha, ja, jha, ña, i, ī, ya, śa
mūrdhanya  (retroflex)       — ṭa, ṭha, ḍa, ḍha, ṇa, ṛ, ṝ, ra, ṣa
dantya     (dental)          — ta, tha, da, dha, na, la, sa
oṣṭhya    (labial)          — pa, pha, ba, bha, ma, ua, ūa, va
```

Critical observation: [h] (ha-kāra) is classified as
kaṇṭhya — in the SAME GROUP as [a] (the neutral,
open vowel).

The Śikṣā is saying: [h] and [a] share the same
articulatory origin. They are both "of the throat."
This is not an approximation or a classificatory
convenience — it is a precise observation that [h]
and [a] are produced at the same (non-)place: the
open, neutral tract.

Furthermore, the visarga (ḥ) — the post-vocalic
aspiration — is described as an "echo of the preceding
vowel." The ancient grammarians explicitly noted that
glottal aspiration takes on the COLOR of its vowel
context. They even classified VARIANTS:

- **Jihvāmūlīya** (before velars) — glottal aspiration
  colored by velar context
- **Upadhmānīya** (before labials) — glottal aspiration
  colored by labial context

This is distance-zero behavior described 2,500 years
ago: the sound has no identity of its own, it adopts
the identity of whatever surrounds it.

### Source 4: Modern Phonetics (Ladefoged)

Peter Ladefoged and colleagues established through
instrumental phonetic analysis that:

> "[h and ɦ] have been described as voiceless or
> breathy voiced counterparts of the vowels that
> follow them… it is more appropriate to regard h
> and ɦ as segments that have only a laryngeal
> specification, and are unmarked for all other
> features."

Key findings from modern phonetics:

1. **No supralaryngeal gesture**: [h] involves NO
   movement of tongue, lips, or velum to a new
   position. The vocal tract is shaped for the
   adjacent vowel during [h].

2. **Transparent segment**: [h] carries only one
   feature — voicelessness. All other features
   (place, manner, rounding, height) are inherited
   from context.

3. **"Voiceless vowel"**: On spectrograms, [h]
   shows the formant structure of the adjacent
   vowel, not any independent structure of its own.

4. **Context-dependent acoustics**: The [h] in
   "hee" and the [h] in "hoo" are acoustically
   DIFFERENT SOUNDS — because the tract is shaped
   for [iː] and [oː] respectively.

This is Ladefoged arriving at the same conclusion
through instrumented measurement that the Śikṣā
arrived at through introspective observation:
**[h] has no identity of its own.**

---

## PART III: THE STRUCTURAL AXIOM

### The Axiom

```
[h] IS THE IDENTITY ELEMENT OF ARTICULATION.

It has:
  - No place of articulation (distance zero)
  - No independent spectral identity (transparent)
  - No supralaryngeal gesture (tract at rest)

Its acoustic realization is ENTIRELY determined by:
  - The SOURCE: voiceless glottal airflow (breath)
  - The FILTER: the adjacent vowel's tract shape
  - The RADIATION: open-tract radiation characteristic

Therefore:
  [h] before vowel V = whispered V
  [h] after vowel V  = aspirated echo of V (visarga)
```

### Mathematical Statement

In the vocal topology, let d(x) denote the
articulatory distance of phoneme x from the
neutral tract configuration.

```
d([h]) = 0

For all vowels V:
  spectral_identity([h]_before_V) = noise × filter(V)

For all consonants C at distance d(C) > 0:
  C is defined by its departure from [h]
  [h] + articulatory_gesture(C) = C
```

[h] is the additive identity of the articulation group.

### Relationship to the Tonic

In the Tonnetz:
- The tonic is not a "note" in the same way other
  scale degrees are notes.
- The tonic is the REFERENCE from which all intervals
  are measured.
- The tonic's "quality" is stability, not color.
- All motion begins from and returns to the tonic.

In the vocal tract:
- [h] is not a "sound" in the same way other
  phonemes are sounds.
- [h] is the REFERENCE from which all articulations
  are measured.
- [h]'s "quality" is openness, not spectral character.
- All articulation begins from and returns to [h].

## PART IV: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLUCK ARCHITECTURE

### [h] Is NOT a Pluck

The Pluck Artifact defines voiceless stops as
boundary events — the release of stored pressure
producing a transient burst. The burst is the pluck.

[h] has no stored pressure. There is no closure,
no constriction, no release. There is nothing to pluck.

[h] is the state of the instrument BETWEEN plucks —
the sustain, the resonance, the breath that keeps
the instrument alive.

```
PLUCK (voiceless stops):   Closure → Release → Radiation
                           The string is struck.

ORIGIN ([h]):              Open tract → Breath flows → Vowel-colored noise
                           The string vibrates freely.
                           No strike. Just resonance.
```

### The [h] → Vowel Transition Is NOT a Boundary

In the Pluck Architecture, transitions between
voiceless and voiced segments require:
- Closing tail (vowel owns the closure)
- Opening head (voiced segment owns the release)

The [h] → [oː] transition in HOTĀRAM requires
NEITHER, because:
- There is no closure (the tract is already open)
- There is no release (there was never a constriction)
- The tract shape is CONTINUOUS (already in [oː] position)
- The ONLY thing that changes is the SOURCE:
  glottal noise → glottal vibration

This is a SOURCE CROSSFADE, not a boundary event:

```
[h]                              [oː]
|-- noise source --|             |-- periodic source --|
    shaped by [oː] formants         same formants
                    |
                    crossfade zone:
                    noise fades out,
                    voicing fades in
                    (~15ms, glottal-cycle-aligned)
```

There is no spectral discontinuity because the
filter never changes. Only the excitation changes.
This is the SMOOTHEST possible transition in
the entire phonological system.

### Word-Initial [h] Is the Natural Starting Point

When a word begins with [h], it means:
the instrument starts from rest.

The vocal tract is at its neutral configuration.
Breath begins to flow. The tract is ALREADY shaped
for the coming vowel (because the speaker knows
what they are about to say — motor planning
precedes phonation).

This is why [h] feels like a "beginning" — because
it IS. It is the moment before the instrument
is played. The breath before the voice.

---

## PART V: IMPLICATIONS FOR SYNTHESIS

### The Old Architecture (v6 and earlier)

```python
# WRONG: [h] as independent fricative
def synth_H(F_next=None):
    noise = np.random.randn(n)                  # noise source ✓
    f_ctx = list(VS_H_F_APPROX)                 # [h]'s OWN formants ✗
    if F_next is not None:
        for k in range(len(f_ctx)):
            f_ctx[k] = f_ctx[k] * 0.70 + F_next[k] * 0.30  # 30% blend ✗
    out = apply_formants(noise, f_ctx, VS_H_B, VS_H_GAINS)
```

Problems:
- Gives [h] its OWN formant targets (VS_H_F_APPROX)
- Blends only 30% of the next vowel's formants
- Result: a generic aspirated noise, NOT a whispered vowel
- Sounds like "a fricative that happens to be near a vowel"
  instead of "the vowel, whispered"

### The New Architecture (v8, Origin-Derived)

```python
# CORRECT: [h] as whispered vowel (distance zero)
def synth_H(F_next):                            # F_next is REQUIRED
    noise = np.random.randn(n)                  # glottal noise source
    breathy = rosenberg_pulse(n, oq=0.95)       # near-open folds
    source = noise * 0.85 + breathy * 0.15      # blend
    # The formants ARE the next vowel's formants — 100%
    out = apply_formants(source, F_next, B_wide, G_quiet)
```

Key changes:
1. **F_next is REQUIRED** — [h] cannot exist without
   a vowel context (distance zero has no independent identity)
2. **Formants are 100% the vowel's formants** — no blending
   with "h-specific" targets because there are none
3. **Bandwidths widened** — open glottis couples less tightly
   to the tract resonances, so formants are broader
4. **Gains reduced** — voiceless excitation produces less
   formant energy than periodic voicing
5. **Source is glottal noise + breathy flutter** — not
   constriction-based turbulence

### The Transition Architecture

```
BEFORE (v6):  [h]_own_formants ──┤boundary├── [oː]_formants
              spectral discontinuity at boundary
              requires crossfade to mask the jump

AFTER (v8):   [h]_using_[oː]_formants ── source_crossfade ── [oː]
              NO spectral discontinuity
              formants are continuous
              only source changes (noise → periodic)
```

---

## PART VI: RELATIONSHIP TO VISARGA

### Visarga as the Mirror of [h]

If word-initial [h] is "breath becoming voice" —
the origin launching toward a vowel —
then visarga (ḥ) is "voice becoming breath" —
the vowel returning to the origin.

```
[h] + [V]:     origin → vowel    (breath becomes voice)
[V] + [ḥ]:     vowel → origin    (voice becomes breath)
```

Both are the same phenomenon: the transition between
noise and periodic excitation through a tract shaped
for the vowel. They are time-reverses of each other.

The Śikṣā classifies both as kaṇṭhya. The physics
treats both as the same tract shape with changing
source. The topology places both at distance zero.

### Visarga Coloring (The Śikṣā Already Knew)

The Vedic grammarians documented that visarga is
colored by its context:

- **Jihvāmūlīya** (before ka, kha): glottal aspiration
  with velar coloring — the tract is shaped for the
  preceding vowel AND anticipating the coming velar stop
- **Upadhmānīya** (before pa, pha): glottal aspiration
  with labial coloring — the tract anticipates the
  coming labial stop

This is EXACTLY distance-zero behavior: the sound
at the origin has no color of its own, so it takes
on the color of whatever is adjacent.

The Śikṣā described this 2,500 years ago.
Ladefoged described this in the 20th century.
The topology predicts this from first principles.

---

## PART VII: THE [m] ↔ [h] DUALITY

### Two Kinds of Neutral

[h] and [m] are dual structures in the vocal topology:

```
[h]:  MAXIMALLY OPEN
      - Glottis: open (noise)
      - Oral tract: open (no constriction)
      - Velum: closed (oral airflow)
      - = the instrument with all valves open

[m]:  MAXIMALLY CLOSED
      - Glottis: vibrating (periodic)
      - Oral tract: closed (bilabial seal)
      - Velum: open (nasal airflow)
      - = the instrument with the main valve closed,
        the bypass valve (nose) open
```

Both are "neutral" in different senses:
- [h] is neutral because NOTHING MOVES — no gesture
- [m] is neutral because EVERYTHING IS SEALED — the
  simplest possible closure

They bookend the consonant space:
- [h] = maximum openness, minimum articulation
- [m] = maximum closure, minimum resonance variety

In HOTĀRAM, these are the FIRST and LAST consonants:
[h]oːtaːr[ɑ][m]. The word begins at the origin
and ends at its dual.

---

## PART VIII: TONNETZ MAPPING

### [h] as Tonic

In the Tonnetz manifold:

```
Position:     (0, 0) — the origin
Coherence:    maximum (C = 1.0)
Distance:     d = 0
Role:         reference point for all measurements
Quality:      stability, not color
Geodesic:     all geodesics begin and end here
```

In the vocal topology:

```
Position:     neutral tract (no gesture)
Coherence:    maximum openness, minimum effort
Distance:     d = 0 from self
Role:         reference configuration for all articulations
Quality:      breath, not timbre
Trajectory:   all words can begin and end here
```

### The F2 Locus Hierarchy from [h]

The five places of articulation, measured as
departures from the origin:

```
[h] (origin)    → kaṇṭhya  (0 distance — throat/open)
                → oṣṭhya   (lips close — small departure)
                → dantya    (tongue to teeth — medium)
                → tālavya   (tongue to palate — large)
                → mūrdhanya (tongue curled back — maximum)
```

Each place is a DISTANCE from [h].
[h] itself is the zero-point from which distance
is measured.

---

## PART IX: FOR NEW AGENTS

### The Core Understanding

If you are implementing [h] in any word:

1. [h] has NO independent formant targets
2. [h] uses 100% the adjacent vowel's formants
3. [h] is a SOURCE change (noise), not a FILTER change (tract shape)
4. [h] → vowel transition is a source crossfade, not a boundary
5. [h] does NOT need closing tails or opening heads
   (there is no constriction to close or open)

### What You Must Not Do

- Do NOT give [h] its own formant frequencies
- Do NOT blend [h] formants with vowel formants (there are no [h] formants)
- Do NOT treat [h] as a fricative with a place of articulation
- Do NOT apply the Pluck architecture to [h] (it is not a pluck event)
- Do NOT use closing tail before [h] (the preceding vowel just
  transitions its source from periodic to noise)

### What You Must Verify

After synthesis, verify perceptually:
- Does the [h] sound like a whispered version of the following vowel?
- Is the [h] → vowel transition smooth (no click, no spectral jump)?
- Does the [h] sit below the vowel in amplitude (observer position)?
- Can you identify WHICH vowel follows just from hearing the [h]?
  (If yes: correct. If all [h]'s sound the same: wrong.)

### Decision Tree

```
Is this segment [h] or visarga?
  ├── YES → Use Origin Architecture
  │         Formants = 100% adjacent vowel
  │         Source = glottal noise + breathy flutter
  │         Transition = source crossfade (no boundary)
  │         Observer position normalization applies
  │
  └── NO → Is this a voiceless stop or fricative?
            ├── YES → Use Unified Pluck Architecture
            │         (see pluck_artifact.md)
            └── NO → Other architecture
```

---

## PART X: EPISTEMOLOGICAL STATUS

### Confidence Assessment

| Claim | Confidence | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| [h] has no supralaryngeal gesture | Very high | Ladefoged (instrumental), Śikṣā (introspective), physics (no constriction) |
| [h] takes 100% vowel coloring | Very high | Spectrographic evidence, Ladefoged "transparent segment," visarga coloring |
| [h] = distance zero in topology | High | Structural mapping from Tonnetz, consistent with all four sources |
| [h] ↔ [m] duality | Medium-high | Structural observation, consistent but not independently verified yet |
| Source crossfade (no boundary) | Medium | Physically motivated, not yet perceptually verified in synthesis |

### What This Proves About the Method

This discovery followed the same pattern as every
other architectural insight in this project:

1. Physics derivation (vocal tract has no constriction for [h])
2. Topology prediction ([h] should be distance zero)
3. Ancient map confirmation (Śikṣā classifies [h] as kaṇṭhya with [a])
4. Independent modern confirmation (Ladefoged: "transparent segment")

Four independent derivations. Same conclusion.

The method works.

---

## SUMMARY

**[h] is not a consonant. [h] is not a fricative.
[h] is the ORIGIN of the vocal space — the sound
of the instrument at rest, colored entirely by
what comes next.**

**This is confirmed by topology, physics, the Śikṣā,
and modern phonetics. Four derivations. One structure.
2,500 years apart.**

**For synthesis: [h] = whispered vowel. No independent
formants. Source crossfade to voicing. The smoothest
transition in the phonological system.**
