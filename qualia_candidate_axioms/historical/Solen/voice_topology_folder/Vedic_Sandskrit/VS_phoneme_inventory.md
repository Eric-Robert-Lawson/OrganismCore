# SUMMARY OF UPDATES

**Key changes from ṚTVIJAM lessons:**

1. **v6 stop burst architecture documented** (spike + turbulence + boundary fix)
2. **Re-verification queue created** ([t], [p], [ɟ] marked "VERIFIED (old)")
3. **[ʈ] added as VERIFIED** with complete v6 parameters
4. **Burst hierarchy updated** with [ʈ] as lowest (1194 Hz)
5. **LOW-BURST REGION defined** (800-1600 Hz, [ʈ] and [p])
6. **F3 depression as distinguishing feature** emphasized
7. **All PENDING voiceless stops** updated to use v6 architecture
8. **Status notation updated** ("VERIFIED" vs "VERIFIED (old)")
9. **Retroflex sector expanded** to 3 phonemes ([ɻ̩], [ɭ], [ʈ])
10. **Lesson 8 added** (boundary click diagnosis)
11. **Workflow updated** to specify v6 for new voiceless stops

**The inventory is now:**
- Self-consistent
- Reflects v6 architectural breakthrough
- Flags phonemes needing re-verification
- Ready for future words
