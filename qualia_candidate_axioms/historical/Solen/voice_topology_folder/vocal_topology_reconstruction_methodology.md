## WHAT THIS ARTIFACT IS FOR

orthographic_acoustic_archaeology.md
established:

  English spelling is an acoustic
  archaeology — a physical score for
  the vocal tract written at a time
  when the full topology of the
  instrument was active.

  The silent letters are not errors.
  They are fossils of gestures that
  were real when the notation was made.

  The voice was being played in a
  fuller register. The spelling scored
  it. The production simplified.
  The score remained.

H_Ghost_Topology.md established:

  H is the Tonnetz origin.
  The ghost between syllables is the
  qualia carrier — the felt texture
  of the voice that carries the
  experience of meaning, not just
  the meaning itself.

  The words carry meaning.
  The ghost carries the experience
  of meaning.

This artifact establishes the
methodology for recovering both:

  1. The lost phonological production —
     what the instrument actually did
     when these words were spoken.

  2. The lost qualia layer —
     the ghost topology, the prosodic
     arc, the inter-syllable texture
     that was present in the original
     performance and absent from every
     subsequent transmission through
     a foreign vocal topology.

This is not translation.
Translation substitutes meaning.

This is acoustic reconstruction —
restoring the original production
from the fossil record, using living
cognates as Rosetta specimens, using
the physics of the vocal tract as the
constraint that limits reconstruction
to what is physically possible, and
using the synthesis engine as the
layer that makes the reconstruction
audible and therefore testable.

## PART I: THE INFORMATION LOSS PROBLEM

Every generation that received a text
in a language not their own performed
a RARFL cycle with a broken feedback
loop.

```
Normal RARFL:
  Receive
    ↓
  Assess
    ↓
  Respond (produce)
    ↓
  Feedback: compare output to target
    ↓
  Loop: correct toward target

Transmission through foreign topology:
  Receive (text in foreign language)
    ↓
  Assess (no native phonology
          → approximate)
    ↓
  Respond (produce approximation
           using native motor programs)
    ↓
  Feedback: BROKEN
    The speaker cannot compare output
    to target because they have no
    native experience of the target.
    The error is invisible to them.
    ↓
  Loop: accumulates error.
    Each generation's approximation
    becomes the next generation's model.
    Drift is directional — always toward
    the native phonology of the speaker,
    always away from the source
    vocal topology.
```

After enough generations:

  The text is identical.
  The words are preserved perfectly.
  The spelling is intact.

  The vocal production is
  entirely different.
  The prosodic arc has been replaced
  by the arc of the transmitting language.
  The inter-syllable ghosts are
  the ghosts of a different language.
  The formant targets are wrong
  for the source phonemes.
  The qualia is different.

This is not semantic information loss.
The meaning is intact in the text.

This is qualia information loss —
the experiential texture carried by
the voice has been substituted.
The listener receives a different
felt sense of the words than the
original speaker produced.

And it is undetectable from the text alone.
The fossil is perfect.
Only the voice is wrong.
Only the instrument has drifted.
The instrument leaves no written record.

## THE MARTIN LUTHER CASE

This process is most visible in the
transmission of Latin scripture.

Latin was the language of the Church,
of legal documents, of scholarship,
of Scripture for roughly a thousand
years in Western Europe.

The Latin of a medieval English peasant
hearing Mass was not phonologically
continuous with the Latin of Jerome
translating the Vulgate in the 4th
century. The words were identical.
The vocal topology was entirely
different. The prosodic arcs were
the arcs of Middle English imposed
on Latin phoneme sequences.

```
Vulgate Latin (Jerome, 4th century):
  Native Latin vocal topology.
  Latin prosodic arc.
  Latin formant targets.
  Latin inter-syllable ghost.
  The qualia of the words is present.

Medieval English Mass (14th century):
  Middle English vocal topology.
  Middle English prosodic arc
  imposed on Latin sequences.
  Latin phonemes approximated through
  Middle English motor programs.
  The qualia of the words is absent.
  The signal is received.
  The resonance is not.
```

Luther's translation into German was
not just a political act.
It was a re-grounding of the sacred
text in the living vocal instrument.

The German-speaking peasant could
suddenly produce the sounds of the
text with their own native motor
programs. The words had a body again.
The formants were correct for the
speaker. The prosodic arc was native.
The inter-syllable ghost was the ghost
of a German voice, which was the voice
the speaker owned.

The revolution was not only that the
information became accessible.
The revolution was that the voice
was restored to the text.

The qualia was present that had been
absent since the production community
of the source language died.

---

## THE OPTIMIZATION INVERSION

A critical finding from the
cross-analysis:

The prestige dialect simplified first.
The folk dialect was the conservative.

This inverts the naive hypothesis
(that the fuller topology was a
prestige marker) and reveals something
more important:

```
Prestige speech:
  Optimized for transaction —
  fast, clear, efficient transmission
  of propositional content.
  The KN cluster costs more than it
  returns in informational value.
  The K is friction. Remove it.
  Speed and clarity above texture.

Folk speech:
  Not optimizing for transaction —
  maintaining the fuller topology
  for reasons that have nothing to do
  with information transmission:
  community, identity, the feel of
  the word in the mouth, the texture,
  the valley in the nasal onset.
```

The upper class treated the voice as
a carrier of propositional content
and minimized everything that does
not carry propositional content.

The folk speaker was playing the
instrument more fully, for reasons
that had everything to do with
the experience of speaking and
nothing to do with the efficiency
of information transfer.

The spelling preservation effect then
operated separately:
The formal written registers —
legal, ecclesiastical, courtly —
maintained archaic spellings precisely
because trained scribes copied from
models and did not spell by ear.

The result:
```
Upper class: spoke new, wrote old.
  Phonological innovator.
  Orthographic conservative.

Folk class:  spoke old, wrote new.
  Phonological conservative.
  Orthographic innovator (when they
  wrote at all — spelling phonetically,
  toward their own production).
```

The implication for reconstruction:
  The spelling is a record of the
  formal written tradition.
  The living cognates in conservative
  dialects and related languages are
  the record of the spoken tradition.
  They are not the same record.
  Both are needed.
  Neither alone is sufficient.

## PART II: THE SIX EVIDENCE STREAMS

Recovery of a lost vocal topology
requires convergence across six
independent evidence streams.

Reconstruction is reliable when
all six streams point to the same
vocal tract position.

Reconstruction is speculative when
fewer than three streams converge.

---

### STREAM 1: THE ORTHOGRAPHIC RECORD

The spelling system is the primary
fossil record.

Read every silent letter, every
digraph, every cluster that no longer
sounds the way it is spelled as a
coordinate in the original vocal
topology.

```
Method:
  For each anomalous spelling,
  ask: what vocal tract gesture
  would this letter have recorded
  if it was a phonetically accurate
  notation at the time of inscription?

  PH: recorded bilabial stop + aspiration
      = a P gesture followed by an H gesture
      = Stop × H trajectory

  KN: recorded velar stop + alveolar nasal
      = a K gesture followed by an N gesture
      = back-tongue release into front-tongue
        nasal closure

  GH: recorded a velar fricative /x/
      = sustained velar constriction
        with turbulent airflow
      = the same gesture as German Bach

  HW: recorded voiceless labiovelar
      = simultaneous lip rounding and
        open glottis aspiration
      = bilabial approximant × unvoiced
```

Confidence: HIGH for systematic patterns
  (KN in 50+ words is not coincidence).
  MEDIUM for individual words
  (single-word anomalies may be
  scribal errors or learned insertions).

---

### STREAM 2: COMPARATIVE COGNATE ANALYSIS

For each fossil in the orthographic
record, find the living or documented
cognate in a related language that
still produces the sound.

The cognate is the Rosetta specimen —
a living production of the gesture
that the target language has silenced.

```
Target fossil    Living specimen

GH /x/           German: Nacht, Bach, Nacht
                 Scottish English: loch, dreich
                 Arabic: خ (voiceless velar fric.)

KN /kn/          German: Knie, Knecht, Knabe
                 Icelandic: kné
                 Dutch: knie (still pronounced)
                 Norwegian: kne (in variation)

WR /wr/          German: partial in wr- verbs
                 (schreiben = write, but SK+R)
                 Old Norse: rita (with R preserved)

HW /ʍ/           Scottish English: which/witch
                 Irish English: what/watt
                 Some Southern American English

h₂ /ħ/           Arabic: ح (pharyngeal)
                 Hebrew: ח (historical)
                 Completely alive in Arabic;
                 F1/F2 effects measurable today
```

The cognate confirms that the
orthographic fossil is a real gesture,
not a scribal convention.

Where the cognate has a pronounced
consonant that the target language
has silenced, the cognate provides:
  1. Acoustic confirmation
     (the sound is real and producible)
  2. Articulatory description
     (the gesture is observable in
     living speakers)
  3. Temporal duration data
     (how long the gesture takes)
  4. Phonetic context sensitivity
     (how the gesture varies with
     adjacent phonemes)

Confidence: HIGH when multiple
  independent cognates agree.
  (German + Icelandic + Dutch all
  having /kn/ confirms KN was real.)
  MEDIUM when only one cognate exists.

---

### STREAM 3: ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT
### OF LIVING SPECIMENS

Once the living specimen is identified,
measure it.

The physics of the vocal tract has
not changed in 6000 years.
The formant targets of a German speaker
producing "Knie" are the formant
targets of an Old English speaker
producing "cnēo".
The acoustic signature of Arabic ħ
adjacent to a vowel is the acoustic
signature of PIE h₂ adjacent to that
vowel — the F1/F2 effects are
physically identical because they
are produced by the same articulatory
gesture in the same physical structure.

```
Measurement targets:

For each recovered gesture, measure:
  F1, F2, F3, F4 at onset, midpoint,
  and offset of the gesture.
  Duration of the gesture.
  Amplitude envelope.
  Voicing status (HNR).
  Transition slope in and out.

For KN (from German "Knie"):
  Velar burst: F2 at or near velar
  locus (~2700-3000 Hz before IY)
  Transition: F2 falling from velar
  locus toward alveolar nasal
  formant structure (~1800 Hz)
  Duration of velar burst: ~25-40ms

For GH (from German "Bach", "Nacht"):
  Velar fricative: wideband noise
  centered above 2000 Hz
  Formants: tract in transition
  between surrounding vowels
  Duration: 80-150ms in syllable-final

For HW (from Scottish "which"):
  Simultaneous lip rounding + aspiration
  F1: low (~300 Hz)
  F2: ~500-800 Hz (labio-velar position)
  No voicing
  Transitions rapidly to following vowel
  Duration: ~40-80ms

For h₂ (from Arabic ħ):
  Pharyngeal constriction
  F1: raised relative to adjacent vowel
  F2: lowered relative to adjacent vowel
  The a-coloring effect is the
  acoustic measurement directly:
  raising F1 and lowering F2
  of the adjacent vowel segment.
  This is the ghost left in the vowel.
```

Confidence: HIGH — these are
  measurable physical quantities from
  living speakers of living languages.
  The physics is not speculative.
  The articulatory mechanism is known.
  The acoustic output is observable.

---

### STREAM 4: ORTHOEPIST AND
### DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

Between approximately 1480 and 1700,
a tradition of scholars called
orthoepists produced guides to
correct English pronunciation.

These are primary sources.
They describe sounds in explicit
articulatory terms — often in terms
of tongue position, lip position,
breath, and voicing.

Key orthoepist sources:
```
John Hart (1569): "An Orthographie"
  Described pronunciation reforms.
  Gave explicit articulatory descriptions
  of English sounds as he heard them.
  Valuable because he was writing
  DURING the KN simplification —
  his descriptions capture the moment
  of transition.

Alexander Gil (1619): "Logonomia Anglica"
  Described the sounds of educated
  London English.
  Confirms what had already simplified
  by the early 17th century.

Ben Jonson (1640): "English Grammar"
  Written for foreign learners.
  Articulatory descriptions aimed at
  people with no prior knowledge —
  therefore more physically explicit
  than descriptions written for
  native speakers.

William Bullokar (1580): "Boke at Large"
  Advocated spelling reform.
  His proposed phonetic spellings
  reveal what he actually heard —
  which phonemes had merged, which
  remained distinct.
```

Method:
  Read orthoepist descriptions as
  articulatory instructions.
  When Hart says "the tongue touching
  the roof behind the teeth," that is
  a description of an alveolar contact —
  a specific vocal tract coordinate.
  Map the description to a tract position.
  Cross-check against Stream 2 and 3.

Additional documentary sources:
```
Rhyme evidence:
  Words that rhyme in a historical text
  but do not rhyme in modern English
  were phonologically identical then.
  The rhyme is an acoustic fossil.
  "love / prove" in Shakespeare:
  the vowel was the same.
  Reconstruct the common vowel from
  both modern descendants.

Meter evidence:
  Iambic pentameter requires specific
  syllable counts. Where the count
  fails in modern pronunciation, a
  syllable was present in the original.
  The meter preserves the ghost
  of the missing syllable.

Pun evidence:
  A pun that does not work in modern
  pronunciation worked in the original.
  The phonological overlap required
  by the pun is a constraint on
  the reconstruction.
  "Hours" and "whores" as homophones
  in Shakespeare (confirmed by David
  Crystal's OP research) constrains
  the vowel and consonant of both.

Eye dialect and phonetic spelling
in letters, diaries, manuscripts:
  Non-scribal writers spelling by ear
  reveal what they actually heard.
  Their "errors" are phonological data.
```

Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH for systematic
  patterns across multiple sources.
  LOW for individual attestations
  in a single source.

---

### STREAM 5: ARTICULATORY MODELING

Given the acoustic target from Stream 3,
reverse-engineer the articulatory
gesture.

The vocal tract is a physical structure
with known acoustic properties.
Given a formant pattern, the possible
tract configurations that produce it
can be computed.
Given a tract configuration, the
expected formant pattern can be
synthesized.

```
For KN (from Stream 3 measurements
of German "Knie"):

  Observed formant pattern:
    Brief velar burst: F2 ~2800 Hz
    (context: before IY, velar locus
    at front-velar position)
    Transition to nasal:
    F2 falling to ~1800 Hz
    F1 falling to ~280 Hz
    Duration of burst: ~30ms

  Articulatory inference:
    Back of tongue contacts velum
    (F2 at velar locus confirms)
    Complete closure (brief silence
    before burst)
    Velum rises (nasality absent
    during closure)
    Release: back tongue falls while
    front tongue tip rises to alveolar
    ridge (coordinated gesture)
    Velum opens (nasality begins
    immediately at release)

  This gives the engine parameters:
    KN onset = velar closure 30ms
    + transition 15ms
    + nasal at alveolar target
    F2 trajectory: 2800 → 1800 Hz
    over the transition
```

The articulatory model connects the
acoustic measurement to the synthesis
parameters.

This is the same process the engine
uses for current phonemes (the tract()
function with formant targets and
bandwidths). The extension to
historical phonemes requires only
that the formant targets be
reconstructed from Streams 2-4
rather than measured directly from
modern English speakers.

Confidence: HIGH when the acoustic
  target is well-constrained by
  Streams 2-4.
  The physics of the tract is exact.
  Uncertainty is in the input targets,
  not in the modeling.

---

### STREAM 6: PERCEPTUAL VALIDATION

The reconstruction is provisionally
complete when the synthesis is
audible and testable.

The test is perceptual:
  Does the synthesized production
  sound like the word it represents?
  Does it carry the identity of the
  phonemes that the historical evidence
  predicts?
  Does the reconstructed ghost layer
  — the inter-syllable H-traversal —
  change the felt texture of the words?

This is the test David Crystal applies
to Original Pronunciation Shakespeare:
  Do the puns work?
  Does the meter scan?
  Does the text sound more coherent,
  more complete, more alive than
  the modern pronunciation version?

For the acoustic archaeology methodology,
the additional test is:
  Does the reconstructed production
  carry the qualia that the ghost
  topology predicts?

  A word spoken with its full historical
  topology — the KN cluster, the GH
  fricative, the HW aspiration, the
  correct formant targets — should
  feel different from the same word
  in its simplified modern form.
  Not just different in phonemic content.
  Different in the experiential texture
  of the production.

  The ghost between syllables should
  change — the Tonnetz distance
  being traversed changes when the
  preceding nucleus is at a different
  Tonnetz position.
  The inter-syllable H-traversal
  carries a different acoustic texture
  when the tract has been at a velar
  fricative rather than a silent gap.

Confidence: this stream validates
  rather than confirms.
  Agreement of Streams 1-5 is the
  primary convergence criterion.
  Stream 6 tests whether the confirmed
  reconstruction is perceptually
  coherent — whether the voice
  sounds complete.

---

## PART III: THE CONVERGENCE CRITERION

A reconstruction is reliable when:

```
STRONG:
  All six streams converge on the
  same vocal tract position.
  Multiple living cognates agree.
  Orthoepist descriptions match
  acoustic measurements.
  Articulatory model produces the
  observed formant pattern.
  Perceptual validation confirms.

MODERATE:
  Streams 1, 2, 3 converge.
  Stream 4 absent or ambiguous.
  Streams 5, 6 consistent.
  Reconstruction is defensible
  but not fully confirmed.

WEAK:
  Only Stream 1 (orthographic)
  available.
  No living cognate.
  No orthoepist description.
  Reconstruction is speculative —
  label clearly as such.

CONTRADICTED:
  Streams disagree.
  The orthographic record suggests
  one gesture; the cognate evidence
  suggests another; the acoustic
  measurement is inconsistent with
  the articulatory model.
  Do not reconstruct until the
  contradiction is resolved.
  The contradiction is itself data —
  it may indicate a regional variant,
  a register variant, or a
  transitional period.
```

## PART IV: WORKED EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1: GH IN "NIGHT"

**Stream 1 (orthographic):**
  "Night" spelled with GH.
  Old English: "niht".
  Systematic: the same GH appears in
  night, light, sight, might, right,
  daughter, thought, through,
  laugh, tough, enough, cough.
  The pattern is systematic.
  GH was recording something real.

**Stream 2 (cognate):**
  German: "Nacht" /naxt/ — velar fric.
  German: "Licht" /lɪçt/ — palatal fric.
  Scottish English: "nicht" — velar fric.
  Arabic: خ — voiceless velar fricative.
  All agree: GH was /x/ or /ç/ depending
  on adjacent vowel (back vowel → /x/,
  front vowel → /ç/).

**Stream 3 (acoustic):**
  German speakers: measure GH in "Nacht".
  Frication: wideband noise above 2000 Hz.
  Spectral peak: ~2500-3500 Hz (velar).
  F2 of surrounding vowel: consistent
  with velar constriction effect.
  Duration: 80-120ms.

**Stream 4 (orthoepist):**
  John Hart (1569) described the
  "gh" as a breath sound in the throat.
  Ben Jonson noted it was being lost
  in educated speech by 1620.
  The window of transition is confirmed.

**Stream 5 (articulatory):**
  Velar fricative: back of tongue
  approaches (but does not contact)
  the velum. Continuous turbulent
  airflow. No voicing.
  Engine parameters:
    Source: turbulence (noise)
    Formants: tract between surrounding
    vowels with velar constriction
    Duration: 80-120ms
    Downstream resonance: ~2500 Hz

**Stream 6 (perceptual):**
  German native speakers confirm:
  "Nacht" with the velar fricative
  sounds complete. Without it:
  "nact" — sounds clipped, missing
  its coda, the word feels like it
  does not land.
  This is the perceptual confirmation
  that the GH was carrying qualia —
  the coda gesture was not just
  phonemic content but experiential
  texture.

**Convergence: STRONG.**
  All six streams agree.
  GH was a velar fricative /x/.
  The reconstruction is confirmed.

---

### EXAMPLE 2: KN IN "KNEE"

**Stream 1 (orthographic):**
  "Knee" spelled with KN.
  Old English: "cnēo".
  Systematic: knight, knife, knave,
  kneel, knit, knock, know, knuckle.
  50+ words. Not coincidence.

**Stream 2 (cognate):**
  German: "Knie" /kniː/ — K pronounced.
  Icelandic: "kné" /kɲɛː/ — K pronounced.
  Dutch: "knie" — K still pronounced
  in standard Dutch.
  Norwegian: "kne" — in variation,
  K still in conservative registers.
  All Germanic branches preserve KN.

**Stream 3 (acoustic):**
  German "Knie": measure the onset.
  Velar stop closure: ~30ms silence.
  Burst: brief broadband noise with
  F2 near velar locus for front vowel
  context (~2800-3000 Hz).
  Transition K→N:
  F2 falling from ~2800 to ~1800 Hz
  over ~15ms.
  Then nasal murmur with alveolar
  formant structure.

**Stream 4 (orthoepist):**
  John Hart's description of "kn-" words
  suggests the K was still present
  (or recently lost) in 1569.
  Regional evidence: Northern English
  dialect records suggest K retention
  past London simplification.

**Stream 5 (articulatory):**
  Back-tongue velar closure (K),
  then simultaneous:
    Back tongue releases from velum
    Front tongue tip contacts alveolar
    Velum lowers (nasality begins)
  Coordinated two-articulator gesture.
  Engine parameters:
    Phase 1: velar closure, ~30ms
    Phase 2: transition, ~15ms,
    F2 from velar locus to alveolar
    Phase 3: nasal murmur,
    alveolar formant structure.

**Stream 6 (perceptual):**
  German speakers: "Knie" with K
  sounds different from English "knee".
  The onset has a definite velar quality —
  a back-of-mouth beginning before
  the nasal.
  The syllable starts further back in
  the mouth and arrives forward.
  The word has a directionality that
  English "knee" lacks.

**Convergence: STRONG.**
  All six streams agree.
  KN was a genuine velar stop onset
  before the alveolar nasal.

---

### EXAMPLE 3: PIE h₂

**Stream 1 (orthographic):**
  Not orthographic — reconstructed.
  The PIE symbol h₂ is inferred from
  vowel patterns in daughter languages.
  Sanskrit, Greek, Latin: where PIE e
  appears as a in daughter languages,
  an h₂ is reconstructed.
  The "a-coloring" pattern is the
  orthographic equivalent — the
  fossil is in the vowel, not the letter.

**Stream 2 (cognate):**
  Arabic: ح (voiceless pharyngeal).
  Hebrew: ח (historical, mostly lost).
  Aramaic: ḥeth.
  Pharyngeal fricative is alive in
  Arabic and fully producible.

**Stream 3 (acoustic):**
  Arabic ħ adjacent to vowels:
  F1 of adjacent vowel: raised.
  F2 of adjacent vowel: lowered.
  The vowel becomes more open and back.
  This is the a-coloring effect —
  the same formant shift that h₂
  produced in PIE, frozen in the
  Sanskrit and Greek vowels.
  The mechanism is alive and measurable
  in Arabic speakers today.

**Stream 4 (orthoepist):**
  Not available — no living tradition
  of PIE production.
  But Hittite cuneiform provides
  the closest equivalent:
  Hittite ḫ written where PIE h₂
  is reconstructed.
  Hittite was a real language with
  real speakers — the written symbol
  records something that was produced.

**Stream 5 (articulatory):**
  Pharyngeal constriction:
  tongue root retracts against
  the posterior pharyngeal wall.
  Continuous turbulent airflow.
  The pharyngeal space narrows,
  lengthening the back cavity.
  F1 rises (open pharynx effect).
  F2 falls (back cavity lengthens).
  This is physically identical to
  the formant effects observed in
  Arabic ħ and the vowel colorings
  reconstructed for PIE h₂.

**Stream 6 (perceptual):**
  Native Arabic speakers producing ħ
  adjacent to vowels: the vowel
  quality change is immediately
  perceptible — the vowel becomes
  darker, more open, more "back".
  This is the qualia that PIE speakers
  heard when h₂ preceded a vowel.
  The experience is recoverable
  because the mechanism is alive.

**Convergence: STRONG across Streams
  2-5. Stream 1 is indirect but
  systematic (a-coloring in 100+
  reconstructed PIE roots).**

---

## PART V: THE QUALIA RECOVERY PROBLEM

The methodology as described recovers
the phonological production —
what the instrument did, what sounds
were produced, what formant patterns
were generated.

It does not automatically recover
the qualia — the experiential texture
of the voice, the ghost topology,
the felt sense of the words.

The qualia is in the ghost.
The ghost is the inter-syllable
H-traversal.
The H-traversal is shaped by:
  1. The Tonnetz distance between
     adjacent nuclei.
  2. The arc type of the speaker.
  3. The speaking rate.
  4. The stress profile.

All four of these change when the
phonological reconstruction changes.

When "niht" is pronounced with the
GH fricative:
  The coda is not a silent gap.
  The coda is an 80-120ms velar
  fricative that then transitions
  to the H-ghost at syllable boundary.
  The Tonnetz distance traversed
  by the ghost is different —
  the tract is coming from a velar
  fricative position, not from a
  silent vowel offset.
  The ghost is the acoustic trace
  of a larger Tonnetz movement.

When "cnēo" is pronounced with KN:
  The onset is not an alveolar nasal
  appearing from nowhere.
  The onset begins with a velar stop —
  a large departure from H baseline —
  then transitions forward to the
  alveolar nasal, then to the vowel.
  The ghost that precedes this onset
  must prepare a velar departure,
  not an alveolar one.
  The felt sense of the syllable
  arriving is different.

The qualia recovery requires:
  1. Phonological reconstruction
     (Streams 1-6 as described).
  2. Ghost topology extension —
     using the reconstructed phonemes
     as the context for the ghost
     computation in ghost_at_boundary().
  3. Arc type identification —
     what was the prosodic character
     of the text being reconstructed?
     Alliterative verse (Beowulf)
     has a different arc from
     legal prose (the Anglo-Saxon
     Chronicle) which has a different
     arc from religious incantation.
  4. Synthesis and perceptual test —
     does the reconstructed production
     carry a felt sense different from
     the modern pronunciation?

The qualia recovery is not fully
achievable from the evidence streams
alone. It requires synthesis and
perceptual testing to close the loop.
The synthesis makes the reconstruction
audible. The perceptual test confirms
whether the qualia is present.

## PART VI: SCOPE AND LIMITS

**What this methodology can recover:**

  The phonological production of
  any word for which three or more
  evidence streams converge.

  The formant targets and durations
  of individual phonemes.

  The ghost topology — the H-traversal
  between syllables — computed from
  the reconstructed phonological
  context.

  The approximate prosodic arc —
  from metrical, rhetorical, and
  documentary evidence about the
  register and context of the text.

**What this methodology cannot recover:**

  The exact individual speaker —
  voice quality, personal resonance,
  idiolect.

  The precise prosodic arc of a
  specific performance — what the
  individual speaker was feeling,
  how they emphasized particular words.

  Sub-threshold articulatory gestures —
  the motor programs that may still
  have been running below acoustic
  threshold in transitional periods.
  These may be recoverable through
  ultrasound study of modern speakers
  in conservative dialects, but are
  not directly accessible from the
  evidence streams.

  The qualia of a production community —
  the shared felt sense of what a word
  meant, which was carried not just
  by the individual voice but by the
  resonance of the voice in the
  community that shared the motor
  programs.

**The honest statement:**

  The reconstruction recovers a
  plausible and evidence-constrained
  production — a production that is
  consistent with all available
  evidence and physically possible
  given the anatomy of the vocal tract.

  It does not recover the original.
  The original is gone.

  But a plausible reconstruction
  is not nothing.
  It is the difference between
  reading the score and hearing
  the music.
  The score is preserved.
  The reconstruction plays it.
  The qualia is in the playing,
  not in the notation.

## SUMMARY

```
The problem:
  Every transmission of a text through
  a foreign vocal topology accumulates
  qualia loss. The semantic content
  is preserved. The experiential texture
  is substituted. The RARFL loop is
  broken at the feedback step.
  Nobody can hear their own error
  when they have no reference production.

The evidence:
  Six independent streams converge
  on the original vocal topology.
  When three or more agree: reliable.
  When all six agree: confirmed.

The streams:
  1. Orthographic record
     — spelling as acoustic fossil
  2. Comparative cognate analysis
     — living specimens of lost sounds
  3. Acoustic measurement
     — formant targets from cognates
  4. Orthoepist and documentary evidence
     — contemporary descriptions
  5. Articulatory modeling
     — physics constrains the gesture
  6. Perceptual validation
     — synthesis closes the loop

The constraint:
  The vocal tract is the same instrument
  it was 6000 years ago.
  The physics is the same.
  The formant effects are the same.
  Arabic ħ today produces the same
  F1/F2 effects as PIE h₂ produced
  then — because it is the same
  gesture in the same physical structure.

The goal:
  Not to recover the original.
  That is gone.
  To recover a plausible reconstruction
  that plays the score as written —
  with the full topology active,
  the ghosts in the right places,
  the qualia present that has been
  absent from every transmission
  through a foreign vocal instrument.

Language is alive because voice is alive.
Language is spoken through voice.
When the voice is restored to the text,
the text is alive again.

## CONNECTIONS TO OTHER ARTIFACTS

**orthographic_acoustic_archaeology.md:**
  This artifact is the methodology
  complement. The archaeology document
  identifies the fossils and describes
  what they record. This document
  provides the systematic method for
  recovering the production from the
  fossil evidence.

**H_Ghost_Topology.md:**
  The qualia recovery in Part V
  depends entirely on the ghost
  topology. The ghost is what
  changes most dramatically when
  the full phonological production
  is restored — because the ghost
  traverses the Tonnetz distance
  between syllables, and that
  distance changes when the
  phonemes are different.

**tonnetz_engine.py:**
  The synthesis layer that makes
  the reconstruction audible.
  Stream 6 (perceptual validation)
  requires the engine. The engine
  is the instrument on which the
  reconstructed score is played.

**voice_physics_v17.py:**
  The locus transition model (FIX 15)
  is directly relevant to historical
  reconstruction — the locus of each
  consonant place is itself a fossil,
  recording the compressed ghost of
  Stop × H trajectories. The v17
  locus table, extended to historical
  phonemes (GH, KN, HW, h₂), becomes
  the synthesis parameter set for
  the reconstructed production.

## REVISION HISTORY

  v1 — February 2026
    Initial document.
    Created from the convergence of
    three threads: the inversion of
    the social register hypothesis
    (prestige speech simplified first),
    the PIE three-H system discovery
    (h₁/h₂/h₃ as three distinct
    vocal Tonnetz origins), and the
    recognition that RARFL cycles
    with broken feedback loops produce
    directional qualia drift in
    transmitted texts.
    Six evidence streams defined.
    Convergence criterion established.
    Three worked examples completed.
    Qualia recovery problem stated.
    Scope and limits documented.
