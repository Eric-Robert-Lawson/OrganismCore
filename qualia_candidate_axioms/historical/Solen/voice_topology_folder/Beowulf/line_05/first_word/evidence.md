PHONEME STRUCTURE:
  SC  [ʃ]   voiceless postalveolar fric. — verified SCYLD
  E   [e]   short close-mid front        — verified GĀR-DENA
  F   [v]   voiced labiodental fric.     — NEW

  NG  [ŋ]   voiced velar nasal           — verified
  G   [ɡ]   voiced velar stop            — verified

NEW PHONEMES:
  [v]: voiced labiodental fricative.
       Allophone of /f/ between voiced
       segments in Old English.
       Spelling: 'f' in manuscript —
       sound: [v] intervocalically.
       Same labiodental constriction
       as [f] — upper teeth against
       lower lip — but vocal folds
       vibrating throughout.
       Centroid similar to [f] but
       lower due to voicing.
       Buzzing quality under frication.
       Word-medial here: [e]→[v]→[ɪ]
       Both flanking segments voiced —
       voicing is continuous through
       the fricative.

       OE examples:
       ofer [ofer→over] — over
       heofon [heovoŋ] — heaven
       drifan [drivaŋ] — to drive
       lifian [liviɑŋ] — to live
       seofon [seovoŋ] — seven

       All intervocalic 'f' in OE
       is [v]. Parameters here
       serve all of them.

REUSED PHONEMES:
