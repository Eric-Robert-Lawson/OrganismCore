## PHONEME RECORD

### SH — voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ]
**New phoneme. 30th verified.**

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing (must be low) | 0.1531 | 0.0–0.35 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.1197 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |
| Centroid (1000–10000 Hz) | 4756 Hz | 2500–5500 Hz | PASS |

**Parameters:**
- Primary band: CF 3800 Hz, BW 2400 Hz
- Secondary band: CF 6000 Hz, BW 2000 Hz
- Combined gain structure produces
  broad mid-high spectral shape
- Lip rounding coarticulation from
  following [y] biases centroid
  slightly lower than neutral [ʃ]

**[ʃ] vs [s] — sibilant distinction (D5):**

| Sibilant | Centroid | Measured in |
|---|---|---|
| [s] alveolar | 7609 Hz | WÆS |
| [ʃ] postalveolar | 4756 Hz | SCYLD |
| Separation | 2853 Hz | — |

Target separation: 2000–6000 Hz.  
Measured: 2853 Hz. Clean.

The 2853 Hz separation is well above
the perceptual threshold for sibilant
distinction. Listeners distinguish
[s] from [ʃ] primarily by centroid
frequency — [s] is sharp and high,
[ʃ] is broader and lower. At 2853 Hz
separation the two sibilants are
unambiguously distinct.

**Acoustic basis of [ʃ] vs [s]:**

The difference is place of articulation:
- [s]: tongue tip at alveolar ridge.
  Short front cavity between tip and
  teeth. Short cavity = high resonance
  = high centroid ~7500 Hz.
- [ʃ]: tongue blade at postalveolar
  region. Longer front cavity between
  blade and teeth. Longer cavity =
  lower resonance = lower centroid
  ~4500 Hz.

The lip rounding that accompanies [ʃ]
(especially before rounded vowels like
[y]) further lowers the centroid by
extending the front cavity. This is
why [ʃ] before [y] in *scyld* has a
centroid slightly lower than [ʃ] in
isolation would.

**OE spelling *sc* = [ʃ] without exception.**

This is one of the most reliable
correspondences in Old English phonology.
Every word spelled with initial *sc*
is [ʃ]:

| OE spelling | IPA | Modern English |
|---|---|---|
| *scyld* | [ʃyld] | shield |
| *scip* | [ʃip] | ship |
| *scēaf* | [ʃeːɑf] | sheaf |
| *sceal* | [ʃeɑl] | shall |
| *sculon* | [ʃulon] | should |
| *scīnan* | [ʃiːnɑn] | shine |
| *scamu* | [ʃɑmu] | shame |

All of these — and dozens more — use
the [ʃ] parameters established here.
The *sc* → [ʃ] correspondence is why
Modern English *sh* words so often
derive from OE *sc* words. The spelling
changed; the sound is the same.

**The sibilant inventory is now complete:**

| Phoneme | Place | Centroid | First word |
|---|---|---|---|
| [s] | alveolar | 7609 Hz | ÆÞELINGAS |
| [ʃ] | postalveolar | 4756 Hz | SCYLD |

Two sibilants. Two distinct centroids.
2853 Hz apart. Unambiguous.

### Y — short close front rounded [y]
Fourth instance. Fully stable.
Post-fricative position here.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.6675 | 0.50–1.0 | PASS |
| F2 centroid (1400–2200 Hz) | 1676 Hz | 1400–2100 Hz | PASS |

F2 1676 Hz — identical to ÞĒOD-CYNINGA
and CYNING instances. Zero variance.

---

### L — voiced alveolar lateral [l]
Fourth singleton instance.
Post-vowel position here — [y]→[l].

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7025 | 0.45–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.3130 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |

RMS 0.3130 — highest [l] instance
recorded. The post-[y] coarticulation
context and the word-medial position
give this instance slightly higher
amplitude than previous [l] instances.
Still well within target.

---

### D — voiced alveolar stop [d]
Sixth instance. Word-final here.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.0898 | 0.01–0.90 | PASS |
| Duration | 70 ms | 50–120 ms | PASS |

---

### Full word — D6

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.2524 | 0.01–0.90 | PASS |
| Duration | 270 ms | 200–420 ms | PASS |

**Segment sequence:**

| Segment | Phoneme | Duration | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| SC | [ʃ] | 80 ms | voiceless fricative |
| Y | [y] | 55 ms | short rounded front vowel |
| L | [l] | 65 ms | voiced lateral |
| D | [d] | 70 ms | voiced stop word-final |

Total: 270 ms. Four segments.
The fricative onset at 80 ms is the
longest segment — [ʃ] is held longer
than [s] (80 ms vs 80 ms — same
duration target, but [ʃ] has a longer
perceptual integration window due to
its lower centroid and broader band).

## LITERARY NOTE

**Scyld Scefing — the founding king:**

Scyld Scefing is the first named
character in Beowulf. He is the
legendary ancestor of the Scylding
dynasty — the Danish royal line
to which Hrothgar belongs. The poem
begins with three and a half lines of
general statement about the Spear-Danish
kings and their deeds (*lines 1–4*),
then names Scyld as the exemplar.

His name means *shield* — he is the
protector, the covering, the defence
of his people. The name is programmatic:
a good king is a shield to his nation.

His origin is mysterious. He arrived
as a foundling — *feasceaft funden*
(found destitute, line 7) — and rose
to become the greatest of kings.
His funeral at sea (*lines 26–52*)
is one of the most celebrated passages
in all of Old English literature:
the body laid in a ship, surrounded
by treasure, sent out to sea alone,
origin and destination unknown.

**Scyld → shield:**
The name is the ancestor of Modern
English *shield* through regular sound
changes:
- OE [ʃ] → ME [ʃ] → ModE [ʃ] — unchanged
- OE [y] → ME [ɪ] → ModE [iː] — unrounding
  and lengthening
- OE [l] → ME [l] → ModE [l] — unchanged
- OE [d] → ME [d] → ModE [d] — unchanged

The word *shield* is the name Scyld,
slightly modified by a millennium of
phonological change.

## SIBILANT INVENTORY — COMPLETE

With [ʃ] verified, the sibilant
inventory of Old English is complete
for the purposes of this reconstruction:

| Phoneme | Description | Centroid | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| [s] | voiceless alveolar fricative | 7609 Hz | ÆÞELINGAS |
| [ʃ] | voiceless postalveolar fricative | 4756 Hz | SCYLD |

Note: [z] (voiced alveolar fricative)
exists in OE as an allophone of [s]
between voiced segments but is not
phonemically contrastive. It does not
require a separate synthesiser — [s]
with voicing onset handles it
contextually.
