## PHONEME RECORD

### K — voiceless velar stop [k]
Second instance. Previously verified
ÞĒOD-CYNINGA. Word-initial here
with aspiration.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing (must be low) | 0.1319 | 0.0–0.35 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.0652 | 0.005–0.70 | PASS |

---

### Y — short close front rounded [y]
Third instance. ÞĒOD-CYNINGA (×2),
now CYNING.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.6675 | 0.50–1.0 | PASS |
| F2 centroid (1400–2200 Hz) | 1676 Hz | 1400–2100 Hz | PASS |

F2 at 1676 Hz confirms the front
rounded quality. Compare:
- [ɪ] F2: 1874 Hz — front unrounded
- [y] F2: 1676 Hz — front rounded

The 198 Hz difference in F2 is the
acoustic signature of lip rounding
on a high front vowel. Rounding
lowers F2 by extending the front
cavity. This is exactly the distinction
between [y] and [ɪ] — same tongue
height, different lip position.

---

### N — voiced alveolar nasal [n]
Eleventh instance. Fully stable.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7748 | 0.65–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS (nasal murmur) | 0.2454 | 0.005–0.25 | PASS |

---

### I — short near-close front [ɪ]
Fourth instance. IN, GĒAR-DAGUM,
ÆÞELINGAS, now CYNING.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.6678 | 0.50–1.0 | PASS |
| F2 centroid (1500–2400 Hz) | 1874 Hz | 1600–2200 Hz | PASS |

---

### NG — voiced velar nasal [ŋ]
Third instance. ÞĒOD-CYNINGA (×2),
now CYNING.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7797 | 0.65–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS (nasal murmur) | 0.2340 | 0.005–0.25 | PASS |

**[ŋ] vs [n] — nasal place distinction:**

| Feature | [n] alveolar | [ŋ] velar |
|---|---|---|
| Closure | tongue tip at ridge | tongue back at velum |
| Antiformant | ~800 Hz | ~2000 Hz |
| RMS | ~0.245 | ~0.234 |
| Voicing | ~0.775 | ~0.780 |

The antiformant is the primary acoustic
distinction between nasal places.
[n] at ~800 Hz — closed oral cavity
with alveolar closure, short front
cavity behind closure produces low
antiformant. [ŋ] at ~2000 Hz — longer
oral cavity behind velar closure
produces higher antiformant.
Both verified. Both stable.

---

### G — voiced velar stop [ɡ] word-final
Seventh instance of [ɡ] overall.
Word-final after [ŋ] — minimal VOT,
light burst, voiced closure continuation.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.0518 | 0.005–0.70 | PASS |
| Duration | 65 ms | 40–100 ms | PASS |

RMS 0.0518 — lower than word-initial
[ɡ] instances (~0.12). Expected.
Word-final stops are lighter than
word-initial. The burst is briefer
and decays to silence immediately —
no following vowel to amplify the
VOT transition.

---

### [ŋɡ] cluster — D7

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ŋ] duration | 60 ms | 40–90 ms | PASS |
| [ɡ] duration | 65 ms | 40–100 ms | PASS |
| Cluster RMS | 0.1664 | 0.005–0.70 | PASS |

**Cluster total: 125 ms.**

The [ŋɡ] cluster is the phonologically
critical feature of this word and of
Old English *ng* generally.

**OE [ŋɡ] vs ModE [ŋ]:**

In Old English, the sequence spelled
*ng* was always realised as [ŋɡ] —
the velar nasal followed by the voiced
velar stop. This is documented in:
- Campbell, *Old English Grammar* (1959)
- Hogg, *A Grammar of Old English* (1992)
- Minkova, *A Historical Phonology of
  English* (2014)

In Middle English, [ɡ] was lost after
[ŋ] in most environments, giving the
Modern English pattern where *sing*,
*king*, *long* all end in bare [ŋ].
The stop survived only in compounds
and derived forms where a vowel
followed: *longer* [lɒŋɡə], *finger*
[fɪŋɡə] in some dialects.

This means every Old English word
spelled with *ng* — *cyning*, *cyningas*,
*cing*, *lang*, *strang*, *ringas* —
had a final [ɡ] that Modern English
has lost. The synthesis correctly
produces this stop. A listener
familiar only with Modern English
will hear it as an unusual sound —
*king* with a final *g* — which is
precisely what it was.

**Two-event verification:**

D7 explicitly confirms two distinct
segments: [ŋ] 60 ms + [ɡ] 65 ms =
125 ms cluster. If the [ɡ] were
absent, the cluster would be 60 ms
of nasal only. The 65 ms additional
duration is the stop, present and
verified.

### Full word — D8

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.2454 | 0.01–0.90 | PASS |
| Duration | 370 ms | 300–600 ms | PASS |

**Segment sequence:**

| Segment | Phoneme | Duration | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| C | [k] | 70 ms | voiceless stop + aspiration |
| Y | [y] | 55 ms | short rounded front vowel |
| N | [n] | 65 ms | alveolar nasal |
| I | [ɪ] | 55 ms | short near-close front |
| NG | [ŋ] | 60 ms | velar nasal |
| G | [ɡ] | 65 ms | voiced velar stop word-final |

Total: 370 ms. Six segments.
The word is temporally even — no
single segment dominates. The [ŋɡ]
cluster at 125 ms combined is the
longest single phonological unit
but is still only 34% of total
duration. This is a dense,
consonant-heavy word: 4 of 6
segments are consonants.

## LINE 4 COMPLETE

```
þæt wæs gōd cyning
that was  a-good  king
```

**The verdict.**

This is the first complete simple
declarative sentence in the poem.
Lines 1–3 were a single complex
sentence with main clause (*wē
gefrūnon* — we have heard) and
subordinate clause (*hu ðā æþelingas
ellen fremedon* — how those princes
performed deeds of courage). Line 4
is four words. Subject, verb,
adjective, noun. No subordination.
No qualification.

The narrator has established:
who the Spear-Danes were, how long
ago it was, what their kings did,
what their princes achieved. Now
the verdict: *þæt wæs gōd cyning*.
That was a good king.

The simplicity is the point. After
the formal, elaborate subordinate
construction of lines 1–3, the
verdict is delivered in the plainest
possible syntax. Four words close
the opening movement.

**Line 4 word-by-word:**

| Word | IPA | Duration | New phonemes |
|---|---|---|---|
| þæt | [θæt] | 200 ms | none |
| wæs | [wæs] | 200 ms | none |
| gōd | [ɡoːd] | 295 ms | [oː] |
| cyning | [kyniŋɡ] | 370 ms | none |
