## NEW PHONEME — [iː]

### Definition
**Long close front unrounded vowel.**

Tongue at maximum height.
Tongue at maximum front position.
Lips spread or neutral — no rounding.
Duration long — approximately double
the short vowel duration.

### Parameters

```
F1:  300 Hz   bandwidth  80 Hz   gain 16.0
F2: 2300 Hz   bandwidth 120 Hz   gain  8.0
F3: 3000 Hz   bandwidth 200 Hz   gain  1.5
F4: 3500 Hz   bandwidth 260 Hz   gain  0.5
Duration: 110 ms
```

### Verified values

| Measure | Target | Measured | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.50–1.0 | 0.8482 | PASS |
| Duration | 90–150 ms | 110 ms | PASS |
| F2 centroid | 2000–2800 Hz | 2280 Hz | PASS |
| F2 vs [ɪ] delta | 400–900 Hz | 580 Hz | PASS |
| F2 vs [y] delta | 600–1100 Hz | 862 Hz | PASS |

### Acoustic position in inventory

**F2 hierarchy — all vowels:**

```
[iː]  2280 Hz  ← highest F2 — maximum front unrounded
[e]   1875 Hz
[eː]  ~1875 Hz  (long counterpart)
[ɪ]   ~1700 Hz  (near-close — estimated)
[y]   1418 Hz  ← rounding pulls F2 down 862 Hz
[u]   ~800 Hz
[o]    748 Hz
[oː]  ~748 Hz
```

**[iː] sits at the top of the F2
hierarchy.** It is the most front,
most unrounded vowel in the inventory.
No other vowel has a higher F2.

### Distinctiveness established

**[iː] vs [ɪ]:**

| Feature | [iː] | [ɪ] |
|---|---|---|
| F2 | 2280 Hz | ~1700 Hz |
| F2 delta | — | 580 Hz lower |
| Duration | 110 ms | ~55 ms |
| Height | fully close | near-close |

Two dimensions of contrast:
F2 height and duration.
Both confirm the distinction.

**[iː] vs [y]:**

| Feature | [iː] | [y] |
|---|---|---|
| F2 | 2280 Hz | 1418 Hz |
| F2 delta | — | 862 Hz lower |
| Rounding | none | rounded |
| F1 | ~300 Hz | ~300 Hz |

F1 identical — same tongue height.
F2 separated by 862 Hz — the
acoustic cost of lip rounding.
Rounding is the sole distinction.
862 Hz quantifies it exactly.

**[iː] vs [eː]:**

| Feature | [iː] | [eː] |
|---|---|---|
| F2 | 2280 Hz | ~1875 Hz |
| F2 delta | — | 405 Hz lower |
| F1 | ~300 Hz | ~450 Hz |
| Height | close | close-mid |

Both front unrounded long vowels.
Distinguished by height: [iː] close,
[eː] close-mid. F1 and F2 both
separate them.

## PHONEME RECORD

### W — voiced labio-velar approximant [w]

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7506 | 0.50–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.3277 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |

---

### IY — long close front unrounded [iː]
**New phoneme. 36th verified.**

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.8482 | 0.50–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.3208 | 0.01–0.90 | PASS |
| Duration | 110 ms | 90–150 ms | PASS |
| F2 centroid | 2280 Hz | 2000–2800 Hz | PASS |
| F2 vs [ɪ] delta | 580 Hz | 400–900 Hz | PASS |
| F2 vs [y] delta | 862 Hz | 600–1100 Hz | PASS |

Voicing 0.8482 — highest vowel
voicing score in the inventory.
The fully close position creates
a very stable, resonant periodic
source with high autocorrelation.
The long duration contributes —
more periods sampled, cleaner
autocorrelation peak.

### F — voiceless labiodental fricative [f]

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing (must be low) | 0.1514 | 0.0–0.35 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.0951 | 0.001–0.50 | PASS |

### Full word — D8

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.2838 | 0.01–0.90 | PASS |
| Duration | 235 ms | 180–310 ms | PASS |

**Segment sequence:**

| Segment | Phoneme | Duration | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| W | [w] | 55 ms | voiced labio-velar approximant |
| IY | [iː] | 110 ms | long close front unrounded |
| F | [f] | 70 ms | voiceless labiodental fricative |

Total: 235 ms. Three segments.

The [iː] accounts for 47% of the
word duration — the long vowel
dominates the word acoustically.
This is correct. Long vowels
in OE carry the primary acoustic
weight of the syllable.

## THE ROUNDING MEASUREMENT

**Lip rounding costs 862 Hz of F2.**

This is now directly measured
from the inventory:

| Vowel | F2 | Rounding |
|---|---|---|
| [iː] | 2280 Hz | none |
| [y] | 1418 Hz | full |
| Delta | 862 Hz | — |

Both vowels have identical
tongue position — close front,
F1 ~300 Hz. The only difference
is lip rounding. The F2 difference
is entirely attributable to rounding.

This is consistent with acoustic
phonetics literature: rounding
lowers F2 by approximately 700–900 Hz
for close front vowels. The
instrument produces 862 Hz —
within the expected range.

The measurement gives us a rounding
coefficient for the instrument:
**862 Hz per full rounding event
at close front position.**

This will be useful for any future
close front rounded vowels and
for verifying that the [y] in
the inventory is correctly positioned.

## ETYMOLOGICAL NOTE

**wīf — woman, wife:**

One of the oldest and most stable
words in the Germanic languages.
Attested in all major OE texts.

**The Great Vowel Shift in one word:**

```
OE   wīf    [wiːf]   — woman, wife
ME   wyf    [wiːf]   — wife
ME   wife   [wɪif]   — transitional
ModE wife   [waɪf]   — wife
```

The OE long high front vowel [iː]
was the starting point of the
Great Vowel Shift — the chain
of vowel changes that transformed
Middle English into Modern English
between approximately 1400–1700.

The highest long vowels [iː] and
[uː] could not rise further — they
were already at the top of the
vowel space. So they diphthongised:

```
[iː] → [ɪi] → [əɪ] → [aɪ]
[uː] → [ʊu] → [əʊ] → [aʊ]
```

*Wīf* [wiːf] → *wife* [waɪf].
*Hūs* [huːs] → *house* [haʊs].
*Tīd* [tiːd] → *tide* [taɪd].
*Mīn* [miːn] → *mine* [maɪn].

The [iː] verified in this word
is the pre-shift vowel. The
reconstruction captures the
sound before the shift occurred.
This is what *wife* sounded like
before English changed.

**wīf-mann → woman:**

*Wīf-mann* — woman-person. The
compound *wīfmann* contracted
through Middle English:
*wīfmann* → *wumman* → *woman*.
The [iː] of *wīf* is entirely
lost in *woman* — the word
has been phonologically
transformed beyond recognition.
Only the spelling hints at the
compound origin.
