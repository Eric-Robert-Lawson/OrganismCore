## WHAT THIS WORD IS

The second word of Beowulf.
The first person plural pronoun.
"We" — but not the modern English "we".

In performance: unstressed.
The word moves quickly toward Gardena.
The scop is not dwelling on "we" —
he is pointing past it toward the subject.
The [eː] is held but not stressed.
It is a grammatical anchor, not a dramatic beat.

The acoustic contrast with HWÆT is immediate
and deliberate: HWÆT begins voiceless,
Wē begins voiced. The poem opens with
silence-to-sound, then sustains sound.
The mead hall hears the difference.

## PHONEME STRUCTURE

Two phonemes:
  [w]   —  voiced labiovelar approximant onset
  [eː]  —  long close-mid front vowel nucleus

Open syllable. No coda.
The word ends on the sustained long vowel.

---

## STREAM 1: ORTHOGRAPHIC
## Confidence: STRONG

The spelling Wē is unambiguous.

W in Old English records the voiced
labiovelar approximant [w] without exception.
There is no ambiguity between W and HW in
Old English manuscripts — scribes maintained
the distinction systematically.
W = [w]. HW = [ʍ]. These are different letters
for different sounds. The W in Wē is
the voiced glide, not the voiceless fricative.

The macron over Ē records vowel length.
Old English scribes used macrons specifically
to distinguish long vowels from short.
Ē with macron = long [eː].
Ē without macron = short [e].
The macron is not decorative. It is phonemic.

The long vowel [eː] is the pre-Great-Vowel-Shift
close-mid front vowel. It did not become [iː]
until approximately 1400–1600 CE.
In 700–1000 CE Old English, Wē = [weː],
not [wiː].

Convergence: both phonemes unambiguous
from spelling alone.

## STREAM 2: COGNATE EVIDENCE
## Confidence: STRONG

### [w] — Voiced Labiovelar Approximant

Germanic cognates:
  German: wir [viːɐ] — "we"
    Modern German has shifted W → [v].
    But the labiovelar position is preserved.
    The consonant is the same place of
    articulation, different voicing character.

  Gothic: weis — "we"
    Gothic preserves [w] faithfully.
    Gothic W = voiced labiovelar glide.
    Direct cognate of Old English Wē.

  Dutch: wij [ʋɛi] — "we"
    Labiodental approximant [ʋ],
    close relative of [w].
    Same voiced, non-fricative character.

  Old Norse: vér — "we"
    V in Old Norse records [w] in this period,
    not the modern [v].
    Same Proto-Germanic root.

  Proto-Germanic: *wīz — "we"
    Reconstructed with initial [w].
    All branches derive from this form.

No branch shows a voiceless or fricative
onset for this word. The [w] is stable
across all Germanic.

### [eː] — Long Close-Mid Front Vowel

The Great Vowel Shift timeline:
  Pre-1400:  [eː] — close-mid front
               (what Old English had)
  1400–1500: [eː] begins raising
  1500–1600: [eː] → [iː] in southern English
  Post-1600: modern English "we" = [wiː]

The shift is documented. Pre-shift [eː] is
the starting point. Old English Wē predates
the shift by 400–600 years minimum.

Living cognates preserving [eː]:
  German: See [zeː] — "lake/sea"
    Long [eː] preserved in modern German.
    F1 ~400 Hz, F2 ~2100 Hz.
    Acoustically measurable from living speakers.
    This is exactly the vowel in Old English Wē.

  French: été [ete] — "summer"
    Long close-mid front [e].
    Same formant position.
    Different phonological context but
    same acoustic target.

  Modern Scottish English preserves [eː]
  in some conservative dialects where
  the Great Vowel Shift did not fully apply.

Convergence: multiple independent branches
confirm [w] onset and pre-shift [eː] vowel.
Confidence: STRONG

## STREAM 3: ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT
## Confidence: STRONG

### [w] measured from English and Germanic:

  Voicing fraction: > 0.45 isolated,
                    > 0.55 in word context
  (W is a glide — voicing builds as
   it approaches the vowel. Isolated
   segment measurement understates
   the true voicing level.)

  Sibilance ratio: < 0.05
  (No fricative component. W is a pure
   approximant — no turbulence.)

  Low-frequency dominance: > 0.50
  (Labiovelar position concentrates
   energy below 800 Hz. Same tract
   position as HW but voiced throughout.)

  Confirmed by diagnostic:
    voicing isolated (back half): 0.4764
    voicing in-word:              0.7288
    sibilance:                    0.0017
    low-freq dominance:           0.9011

### [eː] measured from German "See":

  F1: 390–530 Hz (IPA close-mid front range)
    Higher tongue position than [æ].
    [æ] F1 was 667.5 Hz — jaw more open.
    [eː] F1 ~409 Hz — tongue raised,
    jaw less open.

  F2: 1900–2400 Hz (front tongue position)
    Similar F2 to [æ] — both front vowels.
    The F2 axis measures tongue frontness.
    Both [æ] and [eː] are front vowels.
    They differ on F1 (jaw height / tongue height)
    not F2 (tongue frontness).

  Duration: approximately 2× the short
    equivalent at the same dilation factor.
    Long vowel length confirmed by macron.

  Confirmed by diagnostic (pitch=110 Hz):
    F1: 409.1 Hz  — IPA [eː] range 390–530
    F2: 2131.8 Hz — front vowel confirmed
    voicing: 0.8486 body zone
    sibilance: 0.0010

All measurements confirmed.
Confidence: STRONG

## STREAM 4: DOCUMENTARY
## Confidence: MODERATE

The Great Vowel Shift is among the
best-documented sound changes in
English linguistic history.

Key references:
  Jespersen (1909): documents the shift
    systematically. Pre-shift [eː] confirmed
    as the Old English long e position.

  Lass (1992), "The Cambridge History of
    the English Language": pre-shift vowel
    inventory documented with formant
    estimates consistent with [eː] at
    F1 ~400 Hz, F2 ~2100 Hz.

  Hogg (1992), "A Grammar of Old English":
    Wē transcribed [weː] throughout.
    Standard scholarly consensus.

No scholarly source disputes [weː] for
Old English wē. The reconstruction is
the established academic position.

The moderate confidence reflects that
we have no audio recordings from 1000 CE,
not that there is scholarly disagreement.
There is no scholarly disagreement.
Confidence: MODERATE
(ceiling imposed by absence of audio;
not by evidential conflict)

## STREAM 5: ARTICULATORY MODELING
## Confidence: STRONG

### [w] articulation:

  Lips: rounded (labiovelar)
  Velum: raised (no nasality)
  Vocal folds: adducted (fully voiced)
  Tongue: raised toward velum
  Airflow: laminar (no turbulence)

  This is identical to HW except:
  HW: vocal folds abducted (voiceless)
  W:  vocal folds adducted (voiced)

  The tract shape is the same.
  The voicing is the only difference.
  This is why HW and W were a minimal pair
  in Old English — same place, different voice.

  The glide character of [w]:
  W does not have a fixed target position.
  It is a transition — the articulators
  are moving FROM the labiovelar configuration
  TOWARD the following vowel.
  The identity of [w] is in the trajectory,
  not in a static target.
  This is why isolated [w] has lower voicing
  than in-word [w] — in isolation the glide
  has no destination to move toward.

### [eː] articulation:

  Lips: unrounded
  Jaw: partially closed (higher than [æ])
  Tongue: front and raised (mid-high position)
  Velum: raised (no nasality)
  Vocal folds: adducted (fully voiced)

  The tongue position for [eː] is between
  [e] (close-mid) and [ɛ] (open-mid).
  F1 ~409 Hz confirms the mid-high position.
  F1 ~668 Hz for [æ] confirms the lower position.
  The physics predicts the formant difference.

  Long vowel mechanics:
  The macron marks a length distinction
  that was phonemically contrastive in
  Old English. Long [eː] is not just
  longer — it is held at a more stable
  target position than the short [e].
  The formant trajectory in [eː] is
  relatively flat across the vowel body.
  No glide, no diphthong. Pure, held vowel.

Confidence: STRONG

## STREAM 6: PERCEPTUAL VALIDATION
## Confidence: STRONG

Cross-verification method:
  Reconstruction derived from first principles.
  Physics predicted formant positions.
  Diagnostic confirmed measurements.
  Independent cross-check:
    German "See" [zeː]: same F1/F2 position.
    French "été" [ete]: same vowel quality.
    IPA [eː] description: consistent.
  All consistent.

Key perceptual distinction:
  Old English [weː] vs modern English [wiː]:
    [weː] F1 ~409 Hz — more open, lower tongue
    [wiː] F1 ~300 Hz — very close, high tongue
  The difference is audible and measurable.
  A German speaker will recognize [weː] as
  familiar — it is their "See" vowel.
  An English speaker will hear it as
  "somewhere between 'we' and 'way'".
  That is the correct perception.
  The vowel was neither. It was [eː].

Confidence: STRONG

## CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT

All six streams converge without conflict.

  Stream 1 (orthographic):     STRONG
  Stream 2 (cognate):          STRONG
  Stream 3 (acoustic):         STRONG
  Stream 4 (documentary):      MODERATE
  Stream 5 (articulatory):     STRONG
  Stream 6 (perceptual):       STRONG

Five strong, one moderate.
No conflicts between streams.
The moderate stream (documentary) reflects
the absence of audio records from 1000 CE,
not any evidential dispute.
There is no scholarly dispute about [weː].

## STRUCTURAL NOTE: THE FIRST VOICED ONSET

Wē is the first word in Beowulf with
a voiced onset. HWÆT began voiceless.
The transition from word 1 to word 2 is:

  [ʍ] voiceless → [w] voiced

Same place of articulation.
Opposite voicing.
The poem opens with the voiceless/voiced
contrast of the labiovelar pair
in consecutive words.

Whether this was deliberate on the poet's part
is unknowable. What is certain is that
the Anglo-Saxon ear heard this contrast
clearly. HW and W were a minimal pair.
The audience's ears were tuned to the
voicing distinction that modern English
has lost entirely.

---

## HISTORICAL NOTE

The last time Wē was spoken as [weː] —
with the close-mid front long vowel
rather than the modern [wiː] —
was approximately 1400–1500 CE,
as the Great Vowel Shift raised [eː] to [iː]
in the developing standard dialect.

Some northern and Scottish dialects
retained older vowel qualities longer.
But the [eː] of Old English Wē had been
replaced in standard speech for over
500 years before this reconstruction.

The vowel is restored.
The physics preserved it.
