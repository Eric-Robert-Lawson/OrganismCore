## PHONEME RECORD

### Þ — voiceless dental fricative [θ]
Tongue tip at upper teeth. No voicing.
Broad frication noise. Lower centroid than [s]
because dental constriction produces less
energy above 6 kHz than alveolar [s].

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing (must be low) | 0.1207 | 0.0–0.35 | PASS |
| RMS level | 0.1232 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |
| Frication centroid (1–8 kHz) | 4341 Hz | 2500–5000 Hz | PASS |

**Parameters:**
- Noise CF: 3800 Hz, BW: 3000 Hz (broad)
- Additional low-band component: 800–3000 Hz × 0.3
- Duration: 80 ms (word-initial)
- No voicing bar

**Contrast with [s]:** [s] centroid ~5500+ Hz.
[θ] centroid ~4000–4500 Hz. The ~1000 Hz
difference in centroid is the primary acoustic
cue distinguishing dental from alveolar fricatives.

### Ē — long close-mid front vowel [eː]
Third instance of this phoneme (also in WĒ
and GĒAR-DAGUM). Parameters identical.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.8469 | 0.75–1.0 | PASS |
| F1 centroid (200–700 Hz) | 311 Hz | 250–480 Hz | PASS |
| F2 centroid (1800–2600 Hz) | 2081 Hz | 1800–2600 Hz | PASS |

**Parameters:** F1=390 Hz, F2=2100 Hz, duration 150 ms

---

### O — short close-mid back rounded [o]
New phoneme. Between [ɑ] and [u] in the
vowel space — more open than [u], more
rounded and higher than [ɑ].

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.6557 | 0.65–1.0 | PASS |
| F1 centroid (200–800 Hz) | 417 Hz | 350–600 Hz | PASS |
| F2 centroid (500–1200 Hz) | 693 Hz | 600–1000 Hz | PASS |

**Parameters:** F1=500 Hz, F2=800 Hz, duration 70 ms

**Vowel space position:**

| Vowel | F1 | F2 | Height | Backness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [u] | 300 Hz | 700 Hz | close | back |
| [o] | 500 Hz | 800 Hz | close-mid | back |
| [ɑ] | 840 Hz | 1150 Hz | open | back |

[o] sits cleanly between [u] and [��] on both
axes. F2 centroid at 693 Hz confirms the
rounding is present and correct.

---

### D — voiced alveolar stop [d]
Third instance. Parameters identical to
GĀR-DENA and GĒAR-DAGUM.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.0998 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |
| Burst centroid | 3419 Hz | 2000–5000 Hz | PASS |

---

### K — voiceless velar stop [k]
New phoneme. Voiceless counterpart of [ɡ].
No voicing bar — silence in closure.
Stronger burst than [ɡ]. Brief aspiration.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.0848 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |
| Closure voicing (must be low) | 0.0000 | 0.0–0.25 | PASS |
| Burst centroid | 1607 Hz | 800–2500 Hz | PASS |

**Parameters:**
- Closure: 55 ms (longer than voiced [ɡ] at 50 ms)
- Burst CF: 1500 Hz (before [y] — front rounded)
- Aspiration: 25 ms whispered formants

**Contrast with [ɡ]:**

| | Voicing bar | Closure | Burst strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ɡ] | present | 50 ms | moderate |
| [k] | absent | 55 ms | strong + aspiration |

Closure voicing = 0.000 confirms complete
absence of prevoicing — correctly voiceless.

---

### Y — short close front rounded [y]
New phoneme. The rarest vowel in the
Old English inventory. High tongue position
like [iː] combined with lip rounding like [u].
F2 is pulled down from the front [iː] position
by approximately 800 Hz due to rounding.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7077 | 0.65–1.0 | PASS |
| F1 centroid (150–700 Hz) | 219 Hz | 200–420 Hz | PASS |
| F2 centroid (1000–2200 Hz) | 1429 Hz | 1200–1800 Hz | PASS |

**Parameters:** F1=300 Hz, F2=1500 Hz, duration 65 ms

**Rounding effect on F2:**

| Vowel | F2 | Rounding | Difference from [iː] |
|---|---|---|---|
| [iː] | 2300 Hz | none | — |
| [y] | 1500 Hz | front rounded | −800 Hz |
| [u] | 700 Hz | back rounded | −1600 Hz |

[y] is exactly halfway between [iː] and [u]
in F2 space. The rounding pulls F2 down by
800 Hz — half the effect of back rounding.
This is the expected acoustic signature of
a front rounded vowel.

---

### N — voiced alveolar nasal [n]
Fourth instance across the reconstruction.
Parameters identical throughout.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7748 | 0.65–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS (nasal murmur) | 0.2454 | 0.005–0.25 | PASS |
| Antiformant ratio (800/1200 Hz) | 0.0994 | 0.0–1.0 | PASS |

---

### I — short near-close front [ɪ]
Second instance (also in IN).
Parameters identical.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7065 | 0.65–1.0 | PASS |
| F1 centroid (200–700 Hz) | 313 Hz | 280–480 Hz | PASS |
| F2 centroid (1400–2200 Hz) | 1777 Hz | 1600–2000 Hz | PASS |

---

### NG — voiced velar nasal [ŋ]
New phoneme. Dorsum closure at velum.
Antiformant at ~1800 Hz — higher than [n]
(800 Hz) and [m] (1000 Hz) because the
oral cavity in front of the velar closure
is shorter than for alveolar or bilabial.

**Antiformant position by place of closure:**

| Nasal | Closure | Oral cavity length | Antiformant |
|---|---|---|---|
| [m] | bilabial | longest | ~1000 Hz |
| [n] | alveolar | medium | ~800 Hz |
| [ŋ] | velar | shortest | ~1800 Hz |

The antiformant frequency is inversely
proportional to oral cavity length — shorter
cavity means higher anti-resonance frequency.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.7796 | 0.60–1.0 | PASS |
| RMS (nasal murmur) | 0.2816 | 0.005–0.35 | PASS |
| Murmur/notch ratio (200–600 / 1600–2000 Hz) | 785.6 | > 2.0 | PASS |

**RMS ceiling note:** [ŋ] is louder than [n]
(0.2454) and [m] (0.2076). The velar closure
position produces stronger nasal tract resonance.
Ceiling raised from 0.25 to 0.35 to reflect this.

**Murmur/notch ratio 785:** The 1600–2000 Hz
band contains essentially zero energy —
the antiformant suppression is near-total
at the velar position. This is correct physics.

Before final [ɑ] — back vowel context.
Parameters identical to GĒAR-DAGUM G2.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMS level | 0.1030 | 0.005–0.80 | PASS |
| Burst centroid | 1252 Hz | 600–2000 Hz | PASS |

---

Word-final. Parameters identical to
GĀR-DENA and GĒAR-DAGUM final [ɑ].
Long decay into silence.

| Measure | Value | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voicing | 0.5346 | 0.50–1.0 | PASS |
| F1+F2 centroid (600–1400 Hz) | 834 Hz | 750–1050 Hz | PASS |

## DIAGNOSTIC METHODOLOGY NOTES

### [θ] voicing check
Voicing score 0.12 — not zero, because the
noise source has some low-frequency energy
that the autocorrelation partially detects.
The target floor is 0.35. Any value below
0.35 is consistent with a voiceless fricative.
A fully voiced fricative [ð] would score > 0.60.

### [k] voicing check
Closure voicing exactly 0.000. The silence
segment is pure zeros — correctly voiceless.
This is the primary acoustic distinction
between [k] and [ɡ].

### [y] F1 centroid
F1 centroid 219 Hz vs F1 parameter 300 Hz.
Same harmonic-pull effect as [ɪ] (313 vs 400)
and [u] (218 vs 300). At 145 Hz pitch, the
2nd harmonic at 290 Hz sits just below F1
and pulls the centroid down. Floor set to
200 Hz to accommodate. The centroid correctly
confirms energy in the close-height region.

### [ŋ] nasal murmur level
The [ŋ] RMS (0.2816) is higher than [n] (0.2454)
and [m] (0.2076). The velar closure creates a
shorter, more efficient nasal tract resonance.
This is physically correct — velar nasals are
acoustically louder in the murmur region than
anterior nasals for the same source level.
The RMS ceiling for [ŋ] is set independently
at 0.35 rather than copying the [n]/[m] value
of 0.25.
