# THE PROSODY OF THE VOICE
## A Reasoning Artifact on Expression, Cadence, and Inflection
## February 2026

---

## PREFACE

This artifact records an insight
that emerged from a single word:

**YES**

Not screamed.
Not flat.
Emphatic.

The capitalization is not volume.
It is weight.
It is the voice arriving
with intention behind it.

The instrument in the mind
communicates the texture of the YES
before the mouth opens.
The mouth is just the output device.

---

## PART 1: PUNCTUATION AS PROSODY NOTATION

Written language has already
solved part of this problem.
We just stopped seeing it clearly.

**Capital letter at sentence start:**
The voice arrives.
Energy rises from baseline.
The first word has weight.
It is not the same as
a word in the middle of a sentence.
It is a beginning.
The instrument engaging.

**Period:**
Full stop.
The voice lands.
Energy returns to baseline.
The breath completes.
The thought is done.
Silence after a period is not emptiness —
it is the landing.
The note resolving.

**Comma:**
Brief continuation pause.
The breath doesn't stop.
The voice eases slightly —
a small dip in energy —
then continues.
The thought is not finished.
The instrument keeps its position.
It just takes a small rest
before the next phrase.

**Question mark:**
Inflection upward at the end.
The voice rises in pitch
on the final syllable or word.
The tract moves toward a higher position.
The folds increase tension.
The fundamental frequency rises.
The observer hears:
uncertainty, inquiry, openness.
The sentence is not resolved.
It is offered outward.

**Exclamation mark:**
Emphatic arrival.
The voice rises TO the final word
then lands with weight.
Not necessarily loud.
Emphatic.
Like: "I think you get it!"
The "it" lands with energy
that carries the whole sentence.

**Ellipsis (...):**
The voice trails.
Energy decreases gradually.
The thought continues
in the mind of the listener.
The instrument doesn't fully stop —
it fades, suggesting continuation
that the voice chose not to complete.

**Dash (—):**
Sudden interruption or pivot.
The voice cuts and redirects.
More abrupt than a comma.
Less resolved than a period.

---

## PART 2: THE YES

```
YES
```

One word.
Capitalized not because it begins
a sentence but because the person
CHOSE to capitalize it
to communicate emphasis.

What the voice actually does:

The Y onset:
  The tract moves from IY position
  opening into the EH/AH vowel.
  This transition IS the Y.
  The movement carries energy.

The EH vowel:
  Sustained at full amplitude.
  The voice is at its peak energy.
  The folds vibrating strongly.
  The diaphragm behind it.

The S release:
  The voice trails into sibilance.
  The folds ease open.
  The tract moves to alveolar constriction.
  The S carries the decay of the word.

The whole gesture:
  Rises into the EH.
  Lands on the S.
  The energy arc is:
  0 → peak → decay.

But emphatic YES vs flat yes:
  Flat: the arc is small and brief.
  Emphatic: the arc is large.
            The EH is held longer.
            The amplitude peak is higher.
            The pitch rises INTO the vowel.
            The onset is faster — more decisive.
            The S is shorter — the word
            ends cleanly, not trailing.

The capitalization instructs:
make the arc large.
arrive with intention.

## PART 3: PROSODY AS THE FIFTH DIMENSION

In the vocal topology artifact
we described five dimensions:

1. Jaw height (F1)
2. Tongue backness (F2)
3. Lip rounding (F2/F3)
4. Velum position (nasality)
5. Constriction degree and place

These describe WHAT the voice says.
The phonemes. The words.

Prosody is a sixth layer —
not a sixth spatial dimension
of the vocal tract,
but a temporal dimension
that modulates all five simultaneously.

**Prosody modulates:**

*Pitch (F0):*
Rising at questions.
Falling at statements.
Rising-falling at exclamations.
The Tonnetz position of the voice
moving expressively through time
independent of the phoneme content.

*Amplitude:*
Louder at stressed syllables.
Quieter at unstressed ones.
Emphatic words peak.
Function words are valleys.

*Duration:*
Stressed vowels are longer.
Unstressed vowels are shorter —
often reduced to schwa (AH).
"always" → the AA is long,
the L-W-EH-Z move through faster.
The stress pattern determines
which phonemes get time
and which are compressed.

*Rate:*
Fast speech: phonemes compress,
coarticulation increases,
phonemes blur into each other.
Slow speech: each phoneme
gets more time,
the trajectory lingers
at each waypoint.
Emphatic speech (like YES):
often slower than baseline
for the emphasized portion —
the voice GIVES the word time
to be felt.

*Voice quality:*
Creaky voice at low energy,
end of phrases, falling off.
Breathy voice in soft or
intimate expression.
Modal voice for normal speech.
Pressed/tense voice for emphasis.
These are all modulations of
how the folds vibrate —
the source quality changing
while the tract position
remains the same.

---

## PART 4: THE CADENCE IS THE VOICE

```
The voice sets its own cadence.
```

This was the key insight from the
breath_rest conversation.

But it goes deeper than pauses.

**The cadence is:**
- The rhythm of stressed and
  unstressed syllables
- The rise and fall of pitch
  across phrases
- The timing of pauses
  (which carry weight, not emptiness)
- The energy arc of each sentence
- The rate of speech
  (faster = casual/excited,
   slower = deliberate/emphatic)

**English stress patterns:**

Iambic: da-DUM
"a-LONE", "be-CAUSE", "the VOICE"

Trochaic: DUM-da
"AL-ways", "WA-ter", "O-pen"

The voice naturally organizes
words into these patterns.
When synthesis ignores stress,
every syllable arrives with
equal weight and equal duration.
The result sounds mechanical.
Not because the phonemes are wrong.
Because the cadence is absent.

**Sentence-level intonation:**

Statement: HIGH — fall to LOW
"The voice was already here."
Voice: rises slightly at start,
falls to baseline on "here."
Period = land.

Question: HIGH — rise at end
"Do you understand?"
Voice: "understand" inflects upward.
The final syllable rises in pitch.
The folds tighten.
F0 increases.
Question mark = rise.

Exclamation: climb — emphatic landing
"I think you get it!"
Voice: energy builds through sentence.
"it" arrives with peak energy.
Then lands decisively.
Exclamation = emphatic arrival + landing.

---

## PART 5: BREATH IS AUTONOMOUS

```
Humans do not breathe
between every word.
Breath is autonomous.
```

This is critical for synthesis.

The breath is not a pause between words.
The breath is continuous.
The diaphragm manages itself.

In natural speech:
- A phrase can be 10-15 words long
  on a single breath.
- The pauses between words
  are NOT breath intake.
- The pauses are cadence —
  they are part of the rhythm.
- Breath intake happens at
  natural phrase boundaries,
  usually coinciding with
  a syntactic break:
  comma, period, or
  before a new clause.

The pause between "always" and "open"
is not the voice breathing.
It is the voice letting "always" land
before "open" arrives.

The breath is underneath everything.
Constant.
The instrument's air supply.
It does not interrupt the voice.
It sustains it.

When breath IS audible in speech:
- It is a choice.
- It adds intimacy or urgency.
- A sharp breath intake
  before an important sentence
  signals the listener:
  something significant is coming.
- A slow exhale at the end of
  a long phrase signals completion.

The breath is expressive
when the speaker makes it so.
Otherwise it is invisible —
a prerequisite for the voice,
not part of its output.

## PART 6: THE WEIGHT OF WORDS

Not all words carry equal weight.

**Function words** (the, a, of, and, to):
- Short duration
- Reduced vowels (often schwa)
- Low amplitude
- No pitch emphasis
- The voice moves through them
  quickly to get to the content

**Content words** (voice, water, always):
- Full vowel realization
- Longer duration
- Higher amplitude on stressed syllable
- Pitch movement on stressed syllable
- The voice dwells here
- These are the meaning

**Emphatic words** (YES, ALWAYS, NEVER):
- All the above, amplified
- The pitch may peak here
  even against the sentence's
  general declination
- Duration extended
- The voice makes time for this word
- The listener knows:
  this is what matters

**The synthesis implication:**

Every word should have a
stress profile assigned to it:

```
function word:  amp=0.65, dur=0.75×
content word:   amp=1.00, dur=1.00×
stressed word:  amp=1.20, dur=1.15×
emphatic word:  amp=1.35, dur=1.30×
```

And within each word:
stressed syllable: amp×1.2, dur×1.2
unstressed syllable: amp×0.7, dur×0.8

The cadence emerges from
these relative weights.
Not from fixed timing.
The rhythm is proportional,
not metronomic.

---

## PART 7: INTONATION AS TONNETZ MOVEMENT

Here is where the two artifacts connect.

The Tonnetz is the pitch space.
Prosody is movement through
that space over time.

**Statement intonation (falling):**
A slow descent in F0.
A path downward in Tonnetz space
across the phrase.
Not a single pitch.
A trajectory.

**Question intonation (rising):**
A rise in F0 at the phrase end.
A sudden movement upward in
Tonnetz space on the final word.

**Exclamation (rise-fall):**
A rise toward the emphatic word.
A decisive landing.
Movement up then anchoring.

**The key:**
This Tonnetz trajectory is
INDEPENDENT of the phoneme trajectory
through vocal topology space.

A question can be asked
at any pitch level.
A statement can be made
at any pitch level.
The intonation contour is a shape —
a curve in Tonnetz space —
that is applied to the utterance
regardless of what the words are.

The voice carries TWO simultaneous
trajectories:

```
V (vocal topology): WHAT is said
T (Tonnetz + prosody): HOW it is said
```

And the HOW is often
more communicative than the WHAT.

"You get it" said with falling intonation:
a statement. I am informing you.

"You get it" said with rising intonation:
a question. I am checking.

"You get it!" said with rise-fall:
an exclamation. I am delighted.

Same phonemes.
Same path through V.
Three completely different meanings —
entirely determined by the path through T.

---

## PART 8: SYNTHESIS IMPLICATIONS

To synthesize natural speech
the engine needs:

**1. Stress assignment:**
Which syllable in each word
carries the primary stress?
This determines:
- Duration scaling
- Amplitude scaling
- Pitch peak placement

**2. Sentence-level intonation contour:**
What is the shape of F0
across the entire phrase?

Three basic shapes:
```
Statement:  /‾‾‾‾\___
Question:   ___/‾‾‾/
Exclaim:    __/‾‾‾\|
```

Applied as a smooth curve
over the F0 of the voiced source.

**3. Pause weight:**
How long does each inter-word rest last?
Determined by:
- Word weight (content vs function)
- Punctuation (comma vs period)
- Rhetorical emphasis

**4. Rate variation:**
The voice slows for emphasis.
Speeds through function words.
The phoneme durations should
scale with stress and intent.

**5. Voice quality modulation:**
Modal for normal speech.
Slightly breathy at phrase ends.
Slightly pressed at emphatic peaks.
These are source modulations —
the Rosenberg pulse parameters
changing with expression.

## PART 9: THE SIMPLEST ENCODING

Punctuation is already
a prosody encoding system.

We can use it directly:

```python
PROSODY = {
    '.': {
        'pause_ms':   200,
        'f0_end':     0.85,   # falls to 85%
        'amp_end':    0.70,
        'rate':       0.95,   # slight slowing
    },
    ',': {
        'pause_ms':   80,
        'f0_end':     1.05,   # slight rise
        'amp_end':    0.85,
        'rate':       1.00,
    },
    '?': {
        'pause_ms':   180,
        'f0_end':     1.25,   # rises clearly
        'amp_end':    0.90,
        'rate':       0.92,
    },
    '!': {
        'pause_ms':   180,
        'f0_end':     1.00,   # lands level
        'amp_end':    1.10,   # emphatic
        'rate':       0.90,
    },
    '...': {
        'pause_ms':   300,
        'f0_end':     0.92,
        'amp_end':    0.50,   # trails
        'rate':       0.88,
    },
}

WORD_STRESS = {
    # stressed syllable carries:
    'amp_scale':  1.20,
    'dur_scale':  1.15,
    'f0_scale':   1.08,
    # unstressed:
    'amp_unstress': 0.72,
    'dur_unstress': 0.80,
}

SENTENCE_CONTOUR = {
    # f0 shape over phrase duration
    # as fraction of base pitch
    'statement': lambda t: 1.05 - 0.20*t,
    'question':  lambda t: 0.95 + 0.30*(t**2),
    'exclaim':   lambda t: (
        1.15*(t/0.6) if t<0.6
        else 1.15*(1-(t-0.6)/0.4)),
}
```

The sentence is parsed.
The punctuation gives the contour.
The stress gives the syllable weights.
The contour is applied to F0.
The weights scale duration and amplitude.

The voice emerges from the text
with its own cadence —
not imposed from outside
but derived from the natural structure
of the language.

## PART 10: THE FULL MODEL

```
TEXT INPUT
  "YES (pause) you get it!"

PARSE:
  YES        → emphatic word
               capitalization = stress marker
               amp×1.35, dur×1.30, f0 peak
  (pause)    → explicit rest
               longer than inter-word breath
               the YES needs to land
  you        → function word, unstressed
  get        → content word, moderate stress
  it         → final word before !
               receives emphatic landing
  !          → exclamation contour
               rise through sentence
               decisive landing on "it"

PROSODY CONTOUR:
  f0: rises from baseline to peak at "it"
      then lands (the exclamation shape)
  
  amp: YES at peak
       you: valley
       get: moderate
       it: peak (emphatic arrival)

SYNTHESIS:
  Each phoneme gets:
    its base duration × stress scale
    its base amplitude × stress scale
    its F0 × contour value at that moment
  
  The voice that results:
    sounds like someone who
    means what they are saying.

OBSERVER:
  In the room.
  Hears: emphatic affirmation,
         a moment of rest for it to land,
         then a delighted confirmation.
  Understands: agreement, enthusiasm,
               recognition.

  Not from the phonemes.
  From the prosody.
  From the cadence.
  From the voice.
```

---

## CONCLUSION

The voice is not just
a sequence of phonemes.

The voice is:
```
WHAT  (phonemes → vocal topology → V)
    ×
HOW   (prosody → Tonnetz trajectory → T)
    ×
WHEN  (timing → cadence → rhythm)
```

The WHAT carries the information.
The HOW carries the meaning.
The WHEN carries the feeling.

A voice without HOW and WHEN
is a list of words.
Intelligible.
But not a voice.

Punctuation is the notation system
that humans already use
to encode HOW and WHEN in text.

Capital letters: emphasis and beginning.
Period: land. Complete. Rest.
Comma: ease. Continue. Brief pause.
Question mark: rise. Open. Inquire.
Exclamation: arrive. Land. Mean it.
Ellipsis: trail. Suggest. Leave open.

These are not decorations.
They are instructions to the instrument.

The instrument reads them
and produces the voice
that carries not just the words
but the experience of saying them.

The topology of the voice
is not just the shape of the tract.
It is the shape of the utterance
through time.

The voice is a gesture.
The gesture has direction.
The direction carries meaning.

And the YES at the beginning of this conversation —
emphatic, weighted, arriving with intention —
was the whole model in a single word.

*Built from the understanding*
*that YES is not just a word.*
*It is a voice.*
*It is an instrument.*
*It is a gesture through space.*
