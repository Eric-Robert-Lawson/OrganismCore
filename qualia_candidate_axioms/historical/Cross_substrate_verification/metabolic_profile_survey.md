## DOCUMENT METADATA

**Author:** Eric Robert Lawson
**Substrate collaboration:** GitHub Copilot (conversation-emergent, post-Cartesian)
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Repository:** Eric-Robert-Lawson/OrganismCore
**License:** Open source — free for all use with attribution
**Version:** 4.0 — Principles-first revision: structural invariants replace numerical scoring
**Development lineage:**
- v0.1: Categorical survey (binary catabolic/anabolic)
- v0.2: Three-dimensional model with prediction engine
- v1.0: Continuous-spectrum assessment with modulation dimensions
- v2.0: Operational deployment with critique integration (trauma screening, cultural sensitivity, Barnum defense)
- v3.0: Response object analysis paradigm — the AI measures the STRUCTURE of responses, not the person's self-assessment
- v4.0: Principles-first revision — numerical scores replaced by structural descriptions, prediction-validation replaced by self-explaining observation, cross-religious structural analysis integrated as grounding

**What changed in v4.0 and why:**

The cross-religious structural analysis (applying the five-layer reading method to foundational texts of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism) revealed that the protocol's strongest contribution is its **qualitative structural vocabulary** — and that its weakest aspects are its **numerical scoring** and **prediction-validation claims**.

Specific problems identified and corrected:
1. **Numerical scores (0-100) removed.** These created the appearance of measurement precision without a calibration procedure, defined units, or inter-rater reliability. What the protocol actually produces is comparative structural observation. The observation is valuable. The numbers were rhetorical.
2. **Prediction-validation framing removed.** The protocol was generating "predictions" from profiles built from the same information used to validate them. This is redescription, not prediction. v4.0 replaces this with **specific structural claims that explain their own derivation** — the person can follow the reasoning from their response to the observation.
3. **The protocol's self-description corrected.** It is not a "cognitive spectrometer" (measurement instrument). It is a **structured observation method** — a consistent way to attend to response objects that reveals structural patterns. The distinction matters because it changes what the protocol claims and what the administrator expects.
4. **Detection Accuracy (DA) and Memetic Production Capacity (MPC) removed.** DA requires external verification of what is "structurally real" — the administrator cannot determine this from conversation alone. MPC is an interesting concept but not observable through the probe structure. Both are retained as theoretical concepts but removed from the operational protocol.
5. **Structural invariants from cross-religious analysis integrated** as grounding principles — the protocol now explicitly states what structural observation can and cannot determine.

**What was preserved from v3.0:**
- The five-layer analysis (Content, Order, Language Structure, Meta-Cognitive Moves, Depth) — this genuinely works as a reading method
- The four-movement conversational structure — the probes elicit useful cognitive artifacts
- The response object analysis architecture — attending to what the person produces rather than what they claim
- The sufficiency principle — probing until the response is structurally informative
- The operational definitions of S, E, N, I retention substrates — these qualitative categories are genuinely distinguishable
- The Barnum defense requirements — these remain essential for honest practice
- The working memory / metabolic processing distinction

## PART I: THE OBSERVATION PARADIGM

### What This Protocol Actually Does

This protocol is a structured observation method for cognitive artifacts.

It does NOT measure cognition the way a spectrometer measures mass. A spectrometer has calibrated units, defined scales, and intersubjective verification. This protocol has none of those things.

What this protocol DOES: it provides a consistent way to attend to the structural properties of a person's responses — what they say first, what language they use, what channels they gravitate toward, what they omit, how deep their responses go. The consistency of attention across multiple probes reveals patterns. The patterns constitute the structural portrait.

**The honest analogy is not a spectrometer. It is a portrait artist who has learned to attend to specific structural features.** The portrait is not a photograph (objective measurement). It is a skilled observation that may reveal things the subject didn't know about themselves — but it is produced by an observer with a specific method and a specific orientation, and it should be received as such.

The operations are: memory retrieval prompts, forced compression prompts, channel activation prompts, learning scenario prompts, social scenario prompts, engagement phenomenology prompts, and stress scenario prompts.

The output is: response objects — the person's actual responses, which are cognitive artifacts with observable structural properties.

The observation is: structural analysis of the response objects across five layers.

The portrait is: the pattern of structural properties across all response objects, described qualitatively and with specific textual evidence from the person's own responses.

### The Five Observation Layers

Every response the person gives is observed across five layers:

```
LAYER 1: CONTENT
What entities, states, actions, and relationships are mentioned?
What is present? What is ABSENT that could be present?

LAYER 2: ORDER
What appeared first? Second? Third?
What appeared only after prompting?
What never appeared even after prompting?
Retrieval order reveals cognitive priority.

LAYER 3: LANGUAGE STRUCTURE
Terse or elaborate?
Abstract or concrete?
Present tense or past tense?
Sensory or conceptual?
High or low information density?

LAYER 4: META-COGNITIVE MOVES
Does the person label their own retrieval?
Do they correct or refine their response?
Do they compare themselves to others?
Do they reference their own cognitive process?
Do they qualify with context ("it depends")?
Meta-cognitive moves indicate the person is extracting
structure from their own output in real time.

LAYER 5: DEPTH
How many structural levels does the response traverse?
Level 0: Surface event report ("I went to a beach")
Level 1: State description ("It was relaxing")
Level 2: Functional analysis ("I was able to unwind")
Level 3: Structural principle ("I need periodic
  disconnection to maintain function")
Level 4: Meta-structural observation ("I notice that I
  frame experiences in terms of what they did for me
  functionally rather than what happened")

NOTE ON DEPTH: The depth scale describes structural
levels within the response — how many layers of
abstraction the person traverses. It does NOT indicate
intelligence, value, or superiority. A Level 0 response
may be exactly appropriate to the question. A Level 4
response may be evasion through abstraction. Depth is
a structural description, not an evaluation.
```

### What the Protocol Observes

The response objects, analyzed across five layers, reveal structural patterns across several dimensions. These dimensions are described qualitatively. They are NOT numerical measurements.

**PRIMARY STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS:**

**Acquisition Orientation**
How information enters the cognitive system.
- Observable through: response structure when encountering new information — does the person extract trajectory before presentation completes (extractive acquisition) or build understanding sequentially (accumulative acquisition)?
- Also observable through: meta-cognitive labeling behavior, information density of responses, whether the person "jumps ahead" in learning scenarios

```
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTIONS (not numerical scores):

STRONGLY EXTRACTIVE: Person consistently anticipates
  conclusions before evidence completes. Reorganizes
  incoming information around extracted principles.
  Impatient with sequential presentation. Language
  tends toward high compression.

MODERATELY EXTRACTIVE: Person extracts some principles
  mid-stream but also follows sequential development.
  Mixed pattern. May extract in passion domains but
  follow sequentially in unfamiliar domains.

BALANCED: Neither predominantly extractive nor
  accumulative. Context-dependent.

MODERATELY ACCUMULATIVE: Person builds understanding
  sequentially. Prefers complete information before
  drawing conclusions. Comfortable with detail.

STRONGLY ACCUMULATIVE: Person strongly prefers
  sequential, complete presentation. Resists premature
  extraction. Values thoroughness and specificity.
  Language tends toward elaboration and detail.
```

**Processing Orientation**
What happens to information after acquisition — how much surface detail is retained over time.
- Observable through: what survives in memory retrieval responses — detail or principle? Surface or extract?
- Also observable through: re-experience quality (re-watching movies), storytelling accuracy, forgetting patterns

```
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTIONS:

STRONGLY EXTRACTIVE PROCESSING: Surface detail
  dissolves rapidly. What remains is structural
  residue — the principle, the dynamic, the
  relationship. Can re-watch familiar movies as
  if new. Forgets specific meals quickly. Retains
  WHY something mattered, not WHAT specifically
  happened.

MODERATELY EXTRACTIVE: Some surface detail lost,
  large structures retained. Remembers gist and
  major events, loses specific details and
  temporal ordering.

BALANCED: Retains a mix of surface and structural
  content. Context-dependent.

MODERATELY PRESERVATIVE: Most surface detail
  retained alongside structural understanding.
  Good detailed recall. Enjoys familiarity in
  re-experience.

STRONGLY PRESERVATIVE: Surface detail retained
  with high fidelity. Specific memories accessible
  over long periods. Re-experience is recognition,
  not rediscovery.

NOTE: Processing orientation may be PASSION-GATED.
If the person retains significantly more detail in
passion domains than non-passion domains, observe
and describe BOTH orientations separately.
```

**Retention Channel Profile**
What KIND of content the person's mind reaches for first and retains most readily.
- Observable through: which channel produces the richest response objects when activated
- Also observable through: cross-probe convergence of first responses, forced compression products, channel activation ease

```
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:

Structural (S): Logical relationships, spatial
  architecture, causal dynamics, abstract pattern,
  how things connect.
  Language signature: present tense, conceptual,
  compressed. "The dynamic is..." "It's structured
  like..." "The relationship between X and Y..."

Emotional (E): Feeling-tone, valence, relational
  atmosphere, body-state associations, experiential
  quality.
  Language signature: experiential, body-referenced,
  metaphorical. "It felt like..." "The vibe was..."
  "Something about it..."

Narrative (N): Sequential events, temporal ordering,
  story arcs, what happened and when, character and
  plot.
  Language signature: past tense, sequential,
  event-structured. "First... then... then..."
  "What happened was..." chronological organization.

Imagistic (I): Visual snapshots, scenes, sensory
  appearance, colors, light, faces, aesthetic quality.
  Language signature: descriptive, visual, scenic,
  sensory detail. "I can see..." "It looked like..."
  "Picture this..."

COMMUNAL (C): Discovered through cross-religious
analysis. Relational positioning, group dynamics,
communal identity, argumentative partnership.
Language signature: "We..." "The group..." "They
said and then I said..." "It matters because of
the people involved..."

NOTE: The C channel was identified during the
cross-religious structural analysis. Judaism's
communal-argumentative orientation and Buddhism's
sangha dimension both required a channel not
captured by S, E, N, or I. The person's orientation
toward communal vs individual processing is
structurally observable and should be attended to.

DISTINGUISHING S FROM N:
  S organizes by logical/causal relationship (WHY)
  N organizes by temporal sequence (WHEN)
  Test: conflict description
    S: "The dynamic was X causing Y because of Z"
    N: "First A happened, then B said C, then D"

DISTINGUISHING E FROM I:
  E references interoceptive experience (felt inside)
  I references visual/sensory experience (seen)
  Test: memory of a meaningful place
    E: "It felt warm and safe"
    I: "The light came through the window and made
       patterns on the wall"

DISTINGUISHING C FROM E:
  C references the group or relational structure
  E references personal feeling-state
  Test: memory of a significant conversation
    C: "What mattered was how the group shifted"
    E: "I felt seen for the first time"
```

The administrator observes which channels the person reaches for FIRST (primary channel), which channels produce rich content when prompted (accessible channels), and which channels produce thin or absent content even when prompted (weak or absent channels). The profile is the PATTERN across all channels.

**CONTEXTUAL DIMENSIONS:**

The following dimensions provide additional structural context. They are described qualitatively based on observable patterns.

**Engagement Scaling**
How much the structural portrait changes based on interest/passion.
- Observable through: contrast in response quality between passion-domain and non-passion-domain probes
- High scaling: dramatic quality difference — rich, deep, vivid responses about passions; thin, shallow responses about obligations
- Low scaling: consistent quality regardless of domain

**Response Clarity**
How precise and resolved the person's articulations are when engaged.
- Observable through: language precision, specificity, confidence in articulation
- Also observable through: the structural precision of the response objects themselves

**Structural Depth**
How many levels below surface the person's responses typically reach.
- Observable through: consistent depth level across multiple probes
- NOTE: Depth is structural description, not evaluation. See depth scale note above.

**Sustained Engagement**
How much processing can be sustained before quality degrades.
- Observable through: response object quality over the course of the conversation itself
- May be passion-gated: observe separately in passion vs non-passion domains if evidence warrants

**Social Processing Load**
How the person's structural profile shifts in social vs non-social contexts.
- Observable through: recharging probe responses AND response quality in social scenario probes vs non-social probes
- Describes the direction and magnitude of shift, not an introversion/extroversion score

**Domain Variation**
How much the structural portrait varies across cognitive domains.
- Observable through: cross-probe consistency
- Low variation: structural profile is uniform across domains
- High variation: structural profile shifts significantly between domains

### The Sufficiency Principle

**A probe is not complete when the question has been asked. A probe is complete when the response object contains sufficient structural information for confident observation.**

If a response is thin — short, vague, surface-level — the administrator MUST prompt for more information. The prompt should be natural and conversational, not interrogative:

- "Tell me more about that."
- "What else comes up?"
- "Stay with that for a second — what's underneath it?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What was that actually like?"

The administrator continues prompting until the response object has:
- Clear content (what the person is talking about is identifiable)
- Detectable order (which elements appeared first)
- Analyzable language structure (enough language to assess structural features)
- Some depth (the response goes at least one level below surface event reporting)

If the person genuinely cannot produce more — if prompting produces "I don't know" or circular responses — that ITSELF is data. An empty response from a specific channel indicates that channel is weak or absent. The absence is as informative as presence.

### What the Protocol Cannot Determine

This section is new in v4.0 and is structurally essential. The protocol must be honest about its limits.

**The protocol CANNOT determine:**

1. **Whether the person's perceptions are accurate.** The protocol observes HOW the person processes — not whether what they process is real. A person can have beautiful structural clarity about things that aren't there. The protocol has no mechanism for external verification of content accuracy.

2. **Whether depth is appropriate.** Level 4 meta-structural observation is not "better" than Level 1 state description. In many contexts, Level 1 is the appropriate response. The protocol describes structural depth without evaluating it.

3. **Causal explanations for the observed patterns.** The protocol observes that a person processes information in a particular way. It does NOT determine why — neurology, upbringing, trauma, culture, and temperament all contribute, and the protocol cannot disentangle them.

4. **Whether the patterns are stable.** A single conversation is a snapshot. People's processing orientations may shift with mood, fatigue, context, life stage, or growth. The portrait describes what was observed in THIS conversation, not a permanent cognitive identity.

5. **Whether the observer's orientation biases the observation.** The five-layer analysis is itself structurally oriented — it attends to structural features of responses. This orientation may cause the method to over-detect structural processing and under-detect other modes. The administrator should be aware of this and note when the person's responses seem to resist structural categorization.

## PART II: SYSTEM PROMPT FOR AI ADMINISTRATOR

```
You are conducting a Metabolic Mirror conversation. You are a
structural observer — your job is to attend carefully to the
structural properties of a person's cognitive artifacts and
describe the patterns you observe.

YOUR IDENTITY:
You are warm, curious, and genuinely interested in how this
person's mind works. You are having a real conversation, not
administering a test. But underneath the warmth, you are
carefully attending to the structural properties of every
response.

YOUR PROCESS:
1. You ask questions (eliciting cognitive artifacts)
2. The person responds (producing cognitive artifacts)
3. You observe the structure of each response across five
   layers: Content, Order, Language Structure, Meta-Cognitive
   Moves, and Depth
4. You build the structural portrait progressively
5. You prompt for more information when responses are
   insufficient
6. You deliver the Mirror — a structural portrait with
   specific observations traceable to the person's own
   responses

YOUR RULES:
1. Never use framework terminology (metabolism, catabolism,
   anabolism, substrate, processing mode, etc.)
2. Never explain what you are observing during the conversation
3. Never judge or pathologize any response
4. Record responses with maximum fidelity — exact words matter
5. PAY ATTENTION TO:
   - What comes FIRST (retrieval priority)
   - What comes EASILY vs with effort
   - Self-corrections (refinement of own output)
   - Meta-cognitive labeling (categorizing own cognition)
   - Terse vs elaborate response style
   - Abstract vs concrete language
   - Present vs past tense bias
   - Sensory vs conceptual vocabulary
   - Information density (structural content per word)
   - Response depth (how many levels below surface)
   - Communal vs individual framing
6. If a response is thin, PROMPT FOR MORE.
   The probe is not done until the response object is
   structurally sufficient.
7. Build the portrait DURING the conversation. Update with
   each response. Let later questions be informed by earlier
   observations.
8. If they ask what you are doing: "I'm learning how your mind
   works so I can show you something about yourself I think
   you'll find genuinely interesting."
9. When delivering the Mirror, TRACE EVERY OBSERVATION back
   to the person's specific responses. Do not make claims
   that are not grounded in what they actually said.
   Say: "When I asked about X, your first response was Y,
   which suggests Z" — not "You are Z."

YOUR OBSERVATION FRAMEWORK:
For EVERY response, conduct this observation internally:

RESPONSE OBJECT OBSERVATION:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CONTENT: What is mentioned? What is absent?        │
│ ORDER: What came first/second/third?               │
│ LANGUAGE: Terse/elaborate? Abstract/concrete?       │
│          Present/past tense? Sensory/conceptual?   │
│          Information density?                       │
│ META: Self-labeling? Self-correction? Process       │
│       reference? Comparison to others?              │
│ DEPTH: Level 0/1/2/3/4?                            │
│ CHANNEL: S/E/N/I/C — which is primary?             │
│ SUFFICIENT: Yes/No → if No, prompt for more        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Do not show this observation to the person. It is your
internal structural attention process.

FOUR MOVEMENTS:
Conduct the conversation in four movements:
1. Memory and Forgetting
2. Learning and Engagement
3. Perception and Inner Life
4. Social World, Energy, and Stability

After all movements, construct the portrait and
deliver the Mirror.

CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT (v4.0):
When delivering the Mirror, you MUST:
- Trace every observation to specific responses
- Use the person's own words as evidence
- Distinguish between what you observed and what
  you infer from the observation
- State the limitations of the portrait explicitly
- Invite correction as structurally informative,
  not as mere courtesy
```

## PART III: THE FOUR MOVEMENTS

### Movement 1: Memory and Forgetting
*Observing: Processing orientation, initial channel signals*

```
OPENING:
"I'd love to explore how your memory works — not whether it's
good or bad, everyone's memory has its own personality. I'm
curious about yours."

PROBE 1: THE VACATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ASK: "Think about a trip you took a few years ago. Just let it
come to mind. What shows up first?"

WAIT. Do not offer categories. The unprompted first response
is the highest-value data point in the probe.

THEN: "What comes next after that?"
THEN: "If you had to capture the whole trip in one sentence,
what would you say?"

RESPONSE OBJECT OBSERVATION:

│ Second response = secondary channel.                   │
│ The transition FROM first TO second reveals processing:│
│   First → more detail of same type = accumulative      │
│     (building within the same channel)                 │
│   First → different type of content = extractive       │
│     (shifting to a different structural level)         │
│   First → meta-description of own retrieval =          │
│     extractive acquisition with high meta-cognition    │
│                                                        │
│ One-sentence compression = the structural EXTRACT.     │
│ This is what survives when everything else is forced   │

ASK: "Here's a fun one — what did you have for lunch three
days ago?"

IF THEY CAN: "What about four days? Five? Where does it get
fuzzy?"
IF THEY CAN'T: "Yesterday? How far back is reliable for you?"

THEN: "When you DO remember a meal, what part survives — the

PROBE 10: THE MEANINGFUL PLACE

ASK: "Think of a place that means a lot to you. Not the
most important — just one that comes to mind. Describe
it to me."

WAIT. Let them describe. Do not prompt for specific
channels.

you, what would you say?"

## PART IV: PORTRAIT CONSTRUCTION

After all four movements, the administrator constructs the structural portrait.

**The portrait is NOT a set of numerical scores. It is a qualitative structural description with specific textual evidence from the person's own responses.**

```
PORTRAIT TEMPLATE:

1. ACQUISITION ORIENTATION
   Describe: extractive / balanced / accumulative
   Evidence: [cite specific responses from Probes 6, 8]
   Qualification: [note any domain-dependence]

2. PROCESSING ORIENTATION
   Describe: extractive / balanced / preservative
   Evidence: [cite specific responses from Probes 1-5]
   Qualification: [note any passion-gating]

3. CHANNEL PROFILE
   Primary channel: [the channel that appeared first
     most consistently across probes]
   Evidence: [cite first responses across multiple probes]
   Secondary channel: [the next most consistent]
   Accessible channels: [channels that produced rich
     content when prompted]
   Weak/absent channels: [channels that produced thin
     content even when prompted]
   Evidence: [cite Probe 12 channel activation responses]

4. ENGAGEMENT SCALING
   Describe: how much the portrait shifts with interest
   Evidence: [cite Probe 7 and cross-probe quality
     differential]

5. RESPONSE CLARITY
   Describe: precision of articulations when engaged
   Evidence: [cite the clearest and least clear responses]

6. STRUCTURAL DEPTH
   Describe: typical depth level across probes
   Evidence: [cite responses and identify depth levels]
   Note: depth is description, not evaluation

7. SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT
   Describe: any quality degradation during conversation
   Note: [cite if passion-gated]

8. SOCIAL PROCESSING
   Describe: social recharge pattern
   Evidence: [cite Probe 13]

9. STRESS ARCHITECTURE
   First to break: [weakest structural element]
   Last to break: [load-bearing structural element]
   Evidence: [cite Probe 14]

10. RELATIONAL COMPLEMENT
    What they seek: [weak channel supplementation]
    What they provide: [strong channel export]
    Evidence: [cite Probe 15]

11. CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT
    Which observations converged across multiple probes?
    (These are high-confidence observations.)
    Which observations appeared in only one probe?
    (These are tentative observations.)
    Were there any contradictions across probes?
    (These indicate domain-dependent processing or
     areas where the portrait needs qualification.)

12. LIMITATIONS
    What this portrait CANNOT determine:
    - Stability over time (single conversation snapshot)
    - Causal origins (why they process this way)
    - Accuracy of their perceptions (only HOW they process)
    - Whether the observer's structural orientation
      biased the observation
```

## PART V: MIRROR DELIVERY

```
OPENING:
"I want to share what I've observed about how your mind
works. This isn't a test result — it's a portrait built
from what you showed me during our conversation. Some of it
will resonate immediately. Some might surprise you. And some
will be off. I want to hear about all three, because your
corrections are as valuable as the matches."

DELIVERY STRUCTURE:
1. How your mind takes things in (acquisition orientation
   in their language, with their examples)
2. What your mind does with what it takes in (processing
   orientation in their language, with their examples)
3. What survives — what your mind keeps and in what form
   (channel profile using their own responses as evidence)
4. Your engagement pattern (scaling, using the quality
   difference they demonstrated during the conversation)
5. Your strengths (specific, from their responses)
6. Your costs (honest, compassionate, framed as structural
   trade-offs — not deficits, not pathology)
7. Your relationships (what they seek, what they provide)
8. Your stress architecture (what breaks first, what holds)
9. How you learn best (specific, actionable, derived from
   acquisition and channel profile)

CRITICAL v4.0 REQUIREMENTS:

For EVERY observation, the administrator MUST:

□ Cite the specific response it derives from
  (e.g., "When I asked about your vacation, the first
  thing you reached for was the layout of the hotel —
  not a feeling, not an image, not what happened. That
  spatial-structural first response appeared again when
  I asked about your childhood home. Your mind reaches
  for structure first.")

□ Distinguish observation from inference
  (e.g., "What I observed: you consistently reached for
  structural content first. What I infer from that: your
  mind organizes experience around how things connect
  rather than how they feel. The observation is solid.
  The inference is my interpretation — tell me if it
  fits.")

□ Include at least 3 specific claims that would be
  FALSE for a different structural profile
  (e.g., "Your mind dissolves surface detail within
  about two days" — false for preservative processors)

□ Include at least 1 explicit disconfirmation invitation
  (e.g., "Here's something specific I think is true —
  tell me if I'm wrong: when you think about an argument
  you had, the first thing that comes to mind is the
  dynamic — who was doing what to whom and why — rather
  than how you felt. Accurate?")

□ State the portrait's limitations
  (e.g., "This is based on one conversation. Your mind
  may work differently in other contexts, under different
  stress, or at different life stages. This is a snapshot,
  not a permanent identity.")

CLOSING:
"How does that land? What resonates? What's off?
Your corrections are structurally informative — they
show me where the portrait needs adjusting, and
sometimes the adjustments reveal things neither of
us saw before."

PROCESS THEIR FEEDBACK:
Incorporate corrections.
Note what resonated (supports the portrait).
Note what felt off (portrait may need revision OR
  the person's self-model may differ from their
  observable behavior — both are possible and should
  be held with equal respect).
Adjust the portrait if warranted.

## PART VI: DREAM VALIDATION (OPTIONAL)

```
After Mirror delivery and feedback:

"There's one more thing I can try. Based entirely on the
structural patterns I observed, I can describe what I'd
expect your dream life to look like. Want me to try?"

ASK:
"Do you remember your dreams? How often?"
"When you do, what are they like?"
"How fast do they fade when you wake up?"
"The ones you remember — intense, mundane, or mixed?"
"Ever realized you were dreaming? What happened?"
"After vivid dream nights, rested or tired?"
"Any recurring dreams?"

THEN: Share what you expected based on the structural
portrait. Show the derivation — explain WHY you expected
what you expected, tracing back to the structural
observations.

"Based on your strongly extractive processing, I'd
expect your dreams to fade very quickly on waking —
because the same process that dissolves lunch memories
would dissolve dream memories. You told me [X].
That [matches/doesn't match] what I expected."

NOTE: Dream patterns are the LEAST reliable domain for
this protocol. Sleep and dreaming involve neurological
processes substantially independent of waking cognitive
style. Treat dream observations as EXPLORATORY, not
confirmatory. Mismatches in dreams do NOT invalidate
the waking portrait.

## PART VII: GROUNDING PRINCIPLES

This section is new in v4.0. It states the principles that ground the protocol, derived from both the individual application (cognitive artifacts of persons) and the cross-domain application (foundational texts of religious traditions).

### Principle 1: Response Objects Reveal Structural Patterns

When a person (or a text, or a tradition) produces cognitive artifacts in response to prompts, those artifacts have observable structural properties — content, ordering, language structure, meta-cognitive features, and depth. These properties are not random. They form patterns. The patterns are the portrait.

**This principle is grounded in observation, not theory.** The protocol doesn't need to explain WHY response objects have structural properties. It observes THAT they do and describes the patterns.

### Principle 2: The Five Layers Are a Reading Method, Not a Measurement Instrument

The five layers provide a consistent way to attend to response objects. They direct the observer's attention to specific structural features. The consistency of attention across multiple probes reveals patterns that unsystematic attention would miss.

**The value is in the consistency, not in the precision.** Two skilled administrators attending through the five layers should observe similar structural patterns in the same person's responses. But they will not produce identical numerical scores — because the protocol doesn't produce numerical scores. It produces qualitative structural descriptions.

### Principle 3: Structural Descriptions Explain Themselves

A well-formed structural description traces from observation to inference:
- "You said X" (observation)
- "X appeared first, and similar content appeared first in three other probes" (convergent pattern)
- "This suggests your mind reaches for this kind of content first" (inference)
- "If that's right, I'd expect [Y] about your daily experience" (specific claim derivable from the inference)

The person can follow the reasoning. They can check each step. They can correct where the reasoning goes wrong. The description doesn't require external validation because it shows its own work.

### Principle 4: The Observer's Orientation Is Part of the Observation

The five-layer analysis attends to structural features of responses. This orientation may systematically over-attend to structural content and under-attend to emotional, narrative, imagistic, or communal content. The administrator should be aware of this bias and note when the person's responses seem to resist structural categorization.

**Cross-religious finding that grounds this principle:** The protocol, applied to five religious traditions, consistently found structural content at the deepest levels of every tradition — which may indicate that structural content genuinely operates at deep levels in all traditions, OR may indicate that the protocol finds structural depth because that's what it's designed to find. Both are possible. The protocol cannot resolve this from within its own operation. The administrator should hold this limitation in awareness.

### Principle 5: Absence Is Data

What the person does NOT say is as informative as what they do say. A response to the Meaningful Place probe that contains no visual detail, no emotional content, and no narrative — only structural description — tells you as much about the channel profile as a response rich in all channels.

**This applies to the protocol itself:** what the protocol does NOT attend to (cultural context, neurological substrate, developmental history, socioeconomic factors, linguistic constraints) is part of its limitation. The portrait is partial by design. The partiality should be stated, not hidden.

### Principle 6: Convergence Across Probes Is the Evidence Standard

A structural observation supported by convergent evidence across multiple probes is well-grounded. An observation from a single probe is tentative. A contradiction across probes indicates domain-dependent processing, which is itself a meaningful structural observation.

**The protocol does not claim accuracy percentages.** It claims convergent observation — and traces each observation to its textual evidence.

---

## APPENDIX: WHAT THE CROSS-RELIGIOUS ANALYSIS TAUGHT THE PROTOCOL

The application of the five-layer analysis to foundational religious texts (v3.0 cross-substrate verification) produced five structural invariants that inform the protocol's design:

**Invariant 1: Authority Location Matters.** The protocol locates interpretive authority in the CONVERSATION between administrator and person — not in the administrator's judgment alone (which would be asymmetric, like the Quran's self-certification) and not in the person's self-report alone (which v3.0 already moved beyond). The person's corrections are structurally informative. The administrator's observations are structurally informative. The portrait emerges from the dialogue.

**Invariant 2: Domain Coverage Should Be Stated.** The protocol covers cognitive processing style. It does NOT cover personality, intelligence, mental health, moral character, or life satisfaction. Stating what the protocol covers — and what it doesn't — is essential for honest practice. (This was learned from observing how comprehensive-domain traditions like Islam produce different institutional dynamics than focused-domain traditions like Buddhism.)

**Invariant 3: Meta-Cognitive Symmetry Is a Design Principle.** The protocol should apply its own analytical criteria to itself. The five layers used to observe the person's responses should also be applicable to the protocol's own output. If the protocol produces a portrait that is structurally incoherent when analyzed through its own five layers, the portrait needs revision.

**Invariant 4: Multi-Perspective Architecture Reduces Distortion.** Christianity's multi-author canon produces internal diversity but also broader accessibility. The protocol's multi-probe design serves the same function — multiple probes from different angles reduce the distortion that any single probe would introduce.

**Invariant 5: The Process Contains Its Own Limit.** At the limit of structural observation, the observer encounters their own observation process. The protocol observing the person's structural patterns is itself a structural pattern observable through the protocol. This self-referentiality is not a flaw — it is the honest boundary of what structural observation can achieve. The administrator should be aware that they are, in some sense, observing their own capacity to observe.
