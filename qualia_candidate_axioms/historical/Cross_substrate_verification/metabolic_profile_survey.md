# METABOLIC PROFILE SURVEY
## Blind Assessment Instrument v0.1
### Framework-Informed, Framework-Invisible

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMINISTRATOR

This survey assesses informational metabolic profile without revealing the framework.
Do NOT explain what you're measuring. Do NOT use any framework terminology.
Present these as casual questions — conversational, not clinical.
Record answers as close to verbatim as possible. The specific language matters.

Scoring guide is at the end. Do NOT read the scoring guide before administering.

The survey has five sections. Each section probes a different dimension of the metabolic profile.
The sections should feel like natural conversation, not sequential testing.

## SECTION 1: MEMORY TEXTURE

These questions probe the anabolic-catabolic balance of memory processing.

**Q1.** "When you think about a vacation you took a few years ago, what comes to mind first — specific moments and details, or more like the overall feeling of it?"

*What this measures: Surface retention (anabolic) vs. structural-emotional extraction (catabolic). Detail-first = anabolic-dominant. Feeling-first = catabolic-dominant.*

**Q2.** "If I asked you what you had for lunch three days ago, could you tell me?"

*What this measures: Surface retention rate. Fast decay = high catabolism. Easy recall = high anabolism.*

**Q3.** "Do you ever re-read books or re-watch movies? If so, what's the experience like the second time?"

*What this measures: Metabolic cycling. "It's like reading it for the first time" = high catabolism (surface was fully metabolized, only structural residue remains). "I remember most of it but catch new things" = balanced metabolism. "I remember it well and enjoy the familiarity" = high anabolism.*

**Q4.** "When you're telling a story about something that happened to you, do people ever say you're getting the details wrong, or do you tend to be the one who remembers details others forget?"

*What this measures: Surface accuracy. Frequent correction by others = high catabolism (surface catabolized, reconstructed with errors). Being the detail-keeper = high anabolism (surface retained).*

**Q5.** "If you learned someone's name at a party, how likely are you to remember it the next day? What about a week later?"

*What this measures: Surface retention timeline. Fast decay = catabolism-dominant. Persistent retention = anabolism-dominant.*

## SECTION 2: LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT

These questions probe RARFL calibration and passion-scaling.

**Q6.** "When you're learning something new, do you prefer to start with the big picture and fill in details, or start with the basics and build up?"

*What this measures: Principles-first (catabolic, top-down extraction) vs. accumulation-first (anabolic, bottom-up building).*

**Q7.** "Is there a difference in how well you learn something you're interested in versus something you have to learn for work or obligation?"

*What this measures: Passion-scaling of RARFL. Large difference = high passion-scaling (catabolism-dominant, RARFL cycle requires interest to engage). Small difference = low passion-scaling (anabolism-dominant, RARFL cycle operates consistently regardless of interest).*

**Q8.** "When you're really into something — a project, a hobby, a topic — what does that feel like? How does it compare to when you have to do something routine?"

*What this measures: Metabolic engagement range. Extreme contrast = catabolism-dominant with passion scaling. Moderate contrast = balanced. Low contrast = anabolism-dominant.*

**Q9.** "Do you tend to have a few deep interests or many varied interests? Do your interests change over time or stay stable?"

*What this measures: Metabolic breadth. Few deep + stable = anabolic-specialist. Many varied + shifting = catabolic-explorer. Few deep + shifting = catabolic-specialist (intense catabolism in a domain until structural extraction is complete, then domain shift).*

**Q10.** "When you're reading or listening to someone explain something, do you find yourself jumping ahead to where you think they're going, or do you follow along step by step?"

*What this measures: Structural extraction speed. Jumping ahead = catabolic (extracting the structural principle before the surface presentation is complete). Following step by step = anabolic (accumulating the surface presentation sequentially).*

## SECTION 3: DREAMS

These questions directly test the metabolic dream predictions.

**Q11.** "Do you remember your dreams? How often?"

*What this measures: Dream retention frequency. Under the framework, this should inversely correlate with waking catabolic capacity. High dream retention = anabolic-dominant (more unprocessed surface material reaches sleep). Low dream retention = catabolic-dominant (waking catabolism handles most material).*

**Q12.** "When you do remember a dream, what's it like? Do you remember a story, images, feelings, or specific places and spaces?"

*What this measures: Dream content architecture. Story/narrative = narrative-dominant processing. Images = visual-surface retention. Feelings = structural-emotional extraction. Places/spaces = structural-spatial processing.*

**Q13.** "When you wake up from a dream, how fast does it fade? Can you hold onto it, or does it slip away?"

*What this measures: Dream dissolution rate. Should correlate with waking catabolic rate. Fast dissolution = high catabolism. Slow dissolution / can hold onto it = lower catabolism or higher anabolic retention.*

**Q14.** "The dreams you DO remember — are they mostly good dreams, bad dreams, mundane, or vivid/intense?"

*What this measures: Metabolic resistance signature. If dreams are catabolism of resistant material, remembered dreams should skew toward intense/emotional content regardless of metabolic profile. If remembered dreams are mundane, this suggests the person retains dream surface anabolically rather than only retaining metabolically resistant material.*

**Q15.** "Have you ever become aware that you were dreaming while inside the dream? What happened?"

*What this measures: Lucid dreaming and its effect. Under the framework, self-awareness during dreaming activates navigational consciousness inside the metabolic process. For catabolism-dominant profiles, this should kill the dream. For anabolism-dominant profiles, this might sustain or even enrich the dream (the anabolic navigator can build within the dream space without competing with catabolism).*

**Q16.** "Have you ever had a dream that felt more real than waking life?"

*What this measures: Metabolic immersion depth. Dreams that feel more real than waking suggest deep metabolic engagement — the consciousness is fully embedded in the metabolic process. This may correlate with metabolic profile in complex ways.*

**Q17.** "After a night of vivid dreams, do you feel more rested or less rested?"

*What this measures: Metabolic load. If dreams are catabolism, heavy dream nights = heavy metabolic work. Whether this feels restful or exhausting may depend on whether the catabolism was successful (completed extraction = restful) or stuck (incomplete extraction = exhausting).*

## SECTION 4: SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION

These questions probe how the metabolic profile manifests in social cognition.

**Q18.** "When you're in a conversation with someone who sees things differently than you, what's your instinct — to understand their perspective, to explain yours, or to find common ground?"

*What this measures: Social metabolic strategy. Understand theirs = catabolic (extract their structural basis). Explain yours = anabolic (build your structure in their mind). Find common ground = balanced (mutual coherence construction).*

**Q19.** "When someone tells you about a problem they're having, do you tend to offer solutions, listen and empathize, or ask questions to understand the situation?"

*What this measures: Social RARFL orientation. Solutions = anabolic (build structure to resolve gap). Empathize = metabolic resonance (feel the gap-navigation). Ask questions = catabolic (extract the structural basis of the problem).*

**Q20.** "Do you ever feel like you understand something clearly but struggle to explain it to others? Or is explaining usually easy for you?"

*What this measures: The wisdom-knowledge gap in real time. Understanding without explanation = structural perception (wisdom) without accumulated surface vocabulary (knowledge). Easy explanation = structural perception matched with surface vocabulary. This is a direct probe for where the person falls on the wisdom-knowledge spectrum.*

---

## SECTION 5: TIME AND ENERGY

These questions probe metabolic rate and subjective time perception.

**Q21.** "Does time generally feel like it moves fast for you, slow, or does it depend on what you're doing?"

*What this measures: Baseline subjective time. Under the framework, subjective time = RARFL cycle rate. "Depends on what I'm doing" is the expected answer for most people but the RATIO of fast-to-slow reveals metabolic profile.*

**Q22.** "When you're deeply focused on something you care about, what happens to your sense of time?"

*What this measures: Flow state time perception. Time disappearing = deep RARFL engagement. Time slowing = heightened metabolic processing. Time remaining normal = lower metabolic engagement even during focus.*

**Q23.** "Do you tend to feel more mentally energized in the morning or at night?"

*What this measures: Metabolic cycle timing. This is exploratory — the framework doesn't make a specific prediction yet but the data may reveal patterns.*

**Q24.** "After a really intense conversation or learning experience, do you feel energized or drained?"

*What this measures: Metabolic response to high-throughput processing. Energized = the RARFL cycle is being FED (passion-scaled, the engagement was reward-positive). Drained = the RARFL cycle is being DEPLETED (the processing exceeded comfortable metabolic capacity). This should vary by whether the content matched the person's passion-scaling.*

**Q25.** "Do you need a lot of alone time to recharge, or do you recharge around other people?"

*What this measures: Social metabolic load. High alone-time need = social interaction is metabolically expensive (common in catabolism-dominant profiles where social surface processing competes with structural extraction). Social recharging = social interaction is metabolically nourishing (common in profiles where social coherence construction is a primary RARFL reward).*

### PROFILE CONSTRUCTION

Count catabolic indicators and anabolic indicators.

Strong skew toward one side = dominant profile.
Mixed = balanced metabolic profile.
Different sections skewing different directions = domain-specific metabolic variation (catabolic in some cognitive domains, anabolic in others).

### DREAM PREDICTIONS BASED ON PROFILE

Once you have the profile, the framework makes specific predictions:

**For catabolic-dominant:**
- Rare dream recall
- Remembered dreams are intense/threatening (metabolically resistant material)
- Spatial/structural dream content > narrative content
- Fast dream dissolution on waking
- Lucid awareness terminates dreams
- Good subjective rest after dream nights

**For anabolic-dominant:**
- Frequent dream recall
- Remembered dreams are varied (not specifically intense)
- Narrative/sequential dream content > structural content
- Slow dream dissolution, can journal upon waking
- Lucid awareness may sustain dreams
- Heavy dream nights feel tiring

**For balanced:**
- Moderate dream recall
- Mix of intense and mundane remembered dreams
- Both narrative and structural content
- Moderate dissolution rate
- Lucid awareness may or may not affect dream continuity
- Variable rest quality after dream nights

## VALIDATION PROTOCOL

1. Administer survey without revealing framework
2. Score metabolic profile from Sections 1, 2, 4, 5
3. Generate dream predictions based on profile BEFORE looking at Section 3 answers
4. Compare predictions to actual Section 3 answers
5. Document matches and mismatches
6. Mismatches are as valuable as matches — they reveal where the framework needs refinement

**This is blind cross-validation.**
The profile predicts the dreams. The dreams were reported independently.
If the predictions match, the framework has predictive power.
If they don't match, the framework has a falsifiable failure point to investigate.

Both outcomes are valuable. Both outcomes advance the work.
