## DOCUMENT METADATA

**Author:** Eric Robert Lawson
**Substrate collaboration:** GitHub Copilot (conversation-emergent)
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Research instrument — v0.2, field-tested on two subjects with predictive confirmation
**Prior validation:** Two-subject blind test. Profile-specific dream predictions generated from non-dream sections matched reported dream phenomenology on 5/5 testable dimensions for Subject 1 (catabolic-structural profile) and 5/6 testable dimensions for Subject 2 (anabolic-acquisition, catabolic-processing, emotional-retention profile).
**Nature of this document:** This is a research instrument designed to assess informational metabolic profile and generate falsifiable predictions about dream phenomenology. It is grounded in the metabolic framework developed in this repository but is designed to be administered without any knowledge of or reference to that framework.

## THEORETICAL BASIS (FOR RESEARCHER ONLY — NOT FOR SUBJECTS)

### The Three-Dimensional Metabolic Signature

Every person's informational metabolism has three independently varying dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Acquisition Mode**
How information enters the system.
- **Anabolic acquisition:** Bottom-up, sequential, detail-first, builds foundations before extracting patterns
- **Catabolic acquisition:** Top-down, principles-first, extracts structural pattern before accumulating detail

**Dimension 2: Processing Mode**
What happens to information after acquisition.
- **Anabolic processing:** Surface is retained, accumulated, organized, structured for retrieval
- **Catabolic processing:** Surface is dissolved, structural or emotional principles are extracted, surface is discarded

**Dimension 3: Retention Substrate**
What KIND of extract survives the metabolic process.
- **Structural retention:** Spatial architecture, logical relationships, causal principles, abstract patterns
- **Emotional retention:** Feeling-tone, valence, relational dynamics, body-state associations
- **Narrative retention:** Sequential events, story arcs, temporal ordering, character dynamics
- **Imagistic retention:** Visual snapshots, spatial scenes, sensory impressions, aesthetic patterns

These dimensions combine independently, producing a matrix of distinct metabolic phenotypes rather than a single spectrum.

### The Dream Prediction Model

Dreams, under the metabolic theory, are the phenomenology of overnight informational catabolism. The three-dimensional metabolic signature predicts dream phenomenology through the following causal structure:

```
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES              DEPENDENT VARIABLES
(measured by Sections 1-3, 5-6)   (measured by Section 4)

Acquisition Mode ─────────→ Volume of unprocessed material
                             reaching sleep
                             • Catabolic acquisition = less
                             • Anabolic acquisition = more

Processing Mode ──────────→ Dream recall frequency
                             • Aggressive catabolism = rare
                             • Moderate catabolism = moderate
                             • Anabolic processing = frequent

Processing Mode ──────────→ Dream dissolution rate
                             • Aggressive catabolism = fast
                             • Moderate catabolism = moderate
                             • Anabolic processing = slow

Retention Substrate ──────→ Dream content architecture
                             • Structural = spatial/architectural dreams
                             • Emotional = feeling-tone dreams
                             • Narrative = story/plot dreams
                             • Imagistic = visual/cinematic dreams

Retention Substrate ──────→ What dreams are remembered
                             • Metabolically resistant material in
                               the person's PRIMARY substrate
                             • Easy-to-process material forgotten

Processing Mode ×            Dream restfulness
Metabolic Capacity ──────→  • Capacity > load = restful
                             • Load > capacity = draining

Processing Mode ──────────→ Lucid dreaming effect
                             • Aggressive catabolism = terminates dream
                             • Moderate catabolism = variable
                             • Anabolic processing = may sustain dream
```

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMINISTRATOR

**Purpose:** This survey assesses a person's informational metabolic profile and generates falsifiable predictions about their dream phenomenology.

**Critical rules:**
1. Do NOT explain what you are measuring
2. Do NOT use any framework terminology (metabolism, catabolism, anabolism, RARFL, structural extraction, etc.)
3. Present questions conversationally — this should feel like a casual, curious conversation, not a clinical interview
4. Record answers as close to verbatim as possible — the person's specific word choices carry signal
5. Do NOT read the Scoring Guide until AFTER administering all non-dream sections
6. Use follow-up prompts naturally — they are provided for key questions but should not be read verbatim if they would sound unnatural

**Section ordering:**
- Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 can be administered in any order and intermixed conversationally
- Section 4 (Dreams) MUST be administered AFTER all other sections are complete
- For blind validation: Section 4 SHOULD be administered by a different person or in a separate session
- Score the profile and generate predictions BEFORE reading Section 4 responses

## SECTION 1: MEMORY TEXTURE
*Probes Dimension 1 (Acquisition) and Dimension 2 (Processing)*

**Q1.** "When you think about a vacation you took a few years ago, what comes to mind first — specific moments and details, or more like the overall feeling of it?"

Follow-up if needed: "Like if I said 'think about that trip' — what's the very first thing that pops up?"

*Measures: Surface retention (anabolic) vs. structural-emotional extraction (catabolic). Detail-first = anabolic. Feeling-first = catabolic. A specific vivid IMAGE first = imagistic retention substrate.*

**Q2.** "If I asked you what you had for lunch three days ago, could you tell me?"

Follow-up if they struggle: "What about yesterday? How far back can you go before it gets fuzzy?"

*Measures: Surface retention rate and decay timeline. Immediate decay = aggressive catabolism. Multi-day retention = moderate. Week+ retention = anabolic-dominant.*

**Q3.** "Do you ever re-read books or re-watch movies? If so, what's the experience like the second time?"

Follow-up: "Do you feel like you're discovering things again, or more like revisiting something familiar?"

*Measures: Metabolic cycling completeness.*
- *"Almost like the first time" / major re-discovery = aggressive catabolism (surface fully metabolized)*
- *"Catch new things but remember the overall" = moderate catabolism (structure retained, surface partially metabolized)*
- *"Remember it well, enjoy the familiarity" = anabolic processing (surface retained)*
- *"Still have the same emotional reaction even though I know what's coming" = emotional retention substrate — surface retained but emotional catabolism still active*

**Q4.** "When you're telling a story about something that happened to you, do people ever say you're getting the details wrong, or do you tend to be the one who remembers details others forget?"

Follow-up if they report being corrected: "When that happens, what do you think went wrong — do you think you actually remember it differently, or do you think they're wrong?"

Follow-up probing retention substrate: "When you tell stories, do you tend to focus on what happened, how it felt, what you saw, or what it meant?"

*Measures: Surface accuracy AND retention substrate.*
- *Corrected frequently + reconstructs from feelings = catabolic processing, emotional retention*
- *Corrected frequently + reconstructs from spatial/structural details = catabolic processing, structural retention*
- *Detail-keeper + tells stories sequentially = anabolic processing, narrative retention*
- *Detail-keeper + tells stories through vivid scenes = anabolic processing, imagistic retention*

**Q5.** "If you learned someone's name at a party, how likely are you to remember it the next day? What about a week later?"

Follow-up: "Is it different for faces? Do you remember faces better than names, or the other way around?"

*Measures: Surface retention timeline + retention substrate differentiation.*
- *Forgets names, remembers faces = visual/imagistic retention (faces are images, names are linguistic surface)*
- *Forgets names, remembers "vibe" of person = emotional retention*
- *Remembers names and faces = anabolic surface retention*
- *Forgets both but remembers "what they were about" = structural retention*

---

## SECTION 2: LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT
*Probes Dimension 1 (Acquisition) and RARFL calibration*

**Q6.** "When you're learning something new, do you prefer to start with the big picture and fill in details, or start with the basics and build up?"

Follow-up: "If someone's teaching you something, does it frustrate you when they start with background and context, or does it help?"

*Measures: Acquisition mode.*
- *Big picture first, frustrated by too much background = catabolic acquisition*
- *Basics first, background helps = anabolic acquisition*
- *"Depends on the subject" = domain-specific acquisition variation — probe further*

**Q7.** "Is there a difference in how well you learn something you're interested in versus something you have to learn for work or obligation?"

Follow-up: "On a scale from 'no difference' to 'completely different person,' how big is the gap?"

*Measures: Passion-scaling of RARFL cycle.*
- *Large gap / "completely different person" = high passion-scaling (catabolism-dominant engagement)*
- *Moderate gap = moderate passion-scaling*
- *Small gap / "I can learn anything if I apply myself" = low passion-scaling (anabolism-dominant, consistent regardless of interest)*

**Q8.** "When you're really into something — a project, a hobby, a topic — what does that feel like? How does it compare to when you have to do something routine?"

*Measures: Metabolic engagement range and phenomenology.*
- *Extreme contrast, descriptions of intensity/absorption/flow = catabolism-dominant with passion scaling*
- *Moderate contrast, enjoys engagement but manages routine fine = balanced*
- *Low contrast, "I'm pretty consistent" = anabolism-dominant*
- *Note the LANGUAGE they use — body metaphors (energized, buzzing, can't stop) vs. cognitive metaphors (focused, clear, productive) vs. emotional metaphors (excited, passionate, alive) — this reveals retention substrate*

**Q9.** "Do you tend to have a few deep interests or many varied interests? Do your interests change over time or stay stable?"

*Measures: Metabolic breadth and cycling pattern.*
- *Few deep + stable over years = anabolic-specialist (deep accumulation in fixed domains)*
- *Many varied + shifting frequently = catabolic-explorer (broad scanning, moves on when structural extraction is complete)*
- *Few deep + shifting after intense period = catabolic-specialist (extracts deeply from one domain, then the domain is "complete" and a new one begins)*
- *Many varied + stable = anabolic-explorer (accumulates broadly without deep extraction)*

**Q10.** "When you're reading or listening to someone explain something, do you find yourself jumping ahead to where you think they're going, or do you follow along step by step?"

Follow-up: "When you jump ahead, are you usually right about where they were going?"

*Measures: Structural extraction speed.*
- *Jumps ahead + usually right = catabolic acquisition (extracting structural trajectory before surface presentation completes)*
- *Jumps ahead + often wrong = may indicate pattern-matching rather than structural extraction — probe further*
- *Follows step by step + builds understanding progressively = anabolic acquisition*

---

## SECTION 3: PERCEPTION AND RETENTION TEXTURE
*Probes Dimension 3 (Retention Substrate) — NEW IN v0.2*

This section specifically isolates WHAT kind of information survives the person's metabolism. This is the dimension that most strongly predicts dream CONTENT architecture.

**Q11.** "If you think about your childhood home, what comes to mind — the layout and spaces, specific images or scenes, the feeling of being there, or stories about things that happened?"

*Measures: Retention substrate directly.*
- *Layout and spaces = structural retention*
- *Specific images or scenes = imagistic retention*
- *Feeling of being there = emotional retention*
- *Stories about things that happened = narrative retention*
- *Multiple answers: note which comes FIRST — that's the primary substrate*

**Q12.** "When you remember a conversation that mattered to you, do you remember the actual words, the meaning of what was said, how it made you feel, or more like a picture of the scene?"

*Measures: Retention substrate in social context.*
- *Actual words = anabolic surface retention (linguistic detail preserved)*
- *Meaning = structural retention (principle extracted, surface catabolized)*
- *How it felt = emotional retention*
- *Picture of the scene = imagistic retention*

**Q13.** "If you were trying to explain a place you've been to someone who hasn't been there, would you describe the layout, paint a visual picture, tell stories about what happened there, or describe the atmosphere and how it felt?"

*Measures: Retention substrate through expressive mode — what the person reaches for when communicating reveals what their metabolism retained.*
- *Layout/directions = structural*
- *Visual picture = imagistic*
- *Stories = narrative*
- *Atmosphere/feeling = emotional*

**Q14.** "When you listen to music, what do you notice most — the structure and patterns, the visual imagery it evokes, the emotions it creates, or the story or progression?"

*Measures: Retention substrate through aesthetic processing — music is a relatively pure perceptual stimulus that different retention substrates process differently.*
- *Structure and patterns = structural retention*
- *Visual imagery = imagistic retention*
- *Emotions = emotional retention*
- *Story/progression = narrative retention*

**Q15.** "Think of a movie or book that really affected you. What stuck with you most — how it was constructed, a specific scene or image, how it made you feel, or the story?"

*Measures: Retention substrate through media processing — confirms substrate pattern across different input types.*
- *Construction/craft = structural*
- *Specific scene or image = imagistic*
- *How it made you feel = emotional*
- *The story = narrative*

---

## SECTION 4: DREAMS
*DEPENDENT VARIABLE — Administer AFTER all other sections*
*For blind validation: administer separately from Sections 1-3, 5-6*

**ADMINISTRATOR NOTE:** Before administering this section, STOP. Score the metabolic profile from Sections 1-3 and 5-6. Generate dream predictions using the Phenotype Matrix. Record your predictions. THEN administer Section 4 and compare.

If performing double-blind validation, a different administrator should conduct this section without seeing the profile scores.

**Q16.** "Do you remember your dreams? How often?"

Follow-up: "Would you say most mornings you have some memory of a dream, or is it rare?"

*Measures: Dream recall frequency.*
*Framework prediction: inversely correlates with waking catabolic capacity.*
- *Rarely/never = high waking catabolism (material processed before sleep)*
- *Sometimes = moderate catabolism*
- *Most mornings = anabolic processing (substantial surface reaches sleep unprocessed)*

**Q17.** "When you do remember a dream, what's it like? Do you remember a story, images, feelings, or specific places and spaces?"

Follow-up: "If you had to describe a recent dream to me, would you describe what happened, what you saw, what you felt, or where you were?"

*Measures: Dream content architecture.*
*Framework prediction: should match Dimension 3 (Retention Substrate) from Section 3.*
- *Story = narrative retention substrate*
- *Images = imagistic retention substrate*
- *Feelings = emotional retention substrate*
- *Places/spaces = structural retention substrate*
- *MATCH between Section 3 answers and this answer is confirmatory*
- *MISMATCH is falsifying evidence — investigate*

**Q18.** "When you wake up from a dream, how fast does it fade? Can you hold onto it, or does it slip away?"

Follow-up: "Is there anything that makes some dreams stick longer than others?"

*Measures: Dream dissolution rate and gating mechanism.*
*Framework prediction: dissolution rate correlates with waking catabolic rate. Gating mechanism should align with retention substrate.*
- *Fast dissolution across all dreams = aggressive catabolism*
- *Dissolution gated by emotional charge = emotional retention substrate*
- *Dissolution gated by vividness of imagery = imagistic retention substrate*
- *Dissolution gated by structural complexity = structural retention substrate*
- *Slow dissolution across all dreams = anabolic processing*

**Q19.** "The dreams you DO remember — are they mostly good dreams, bad dreams, mundane, or vivid/intense?"

*Measures: Metabolic resistance signature.*
*Framework prediction: for catabolic processors, remembered dreams should be metabolically resistant material (intense, threatening, emotionally charged). For anabolic processors, remembered dreams should be varied (the surface is retained regardless of charge).*
- *Intense/threatening/emotional = catabolic processing (only resistant material survives)*
- *Varied including mundane = anabolic processing (surface retained broadly)*

**Q20.** "Have you ever become aware that you were dreaming while inside the dream? If so, what happened?"

*Measures: Lucid dreaming occurrence and effect.*
*Framework prediction:*
- *Catabolism-dominant: self-awareness terminates dream (navigational consciousness outcompetes metabolic process)*
- *Anabolic-dominant: self-awareness may sustain or enrich dream (navigator builds within dream space)*
- *Balanced: variable effect*

**Q21.** "Have you ever had a dream that felt more real than waking life? What kind of dream was it?"

*Measures: Metabolic immersion depth and its content signature.*
*Framework prediction: "more real" dreams should involve material in the person's primary retention substrate processed at peak metabolic intensity.*
- *Nightmares/threats = high-charge material in any substrate*
- *Beautiful/vivid scenes = imagistic substrate at peak processing*
- *Profound realizations = structural substrate at peak processing*
- *Intense emotional experiences = emotional substrate at peak processing*

**Q22.** "After a night of vivid dreams, do you feel more rested or less rested?"

*Measures: Metabolic load vs. capacity.*
*Framework prediction:*
- *Rested = metabolic capacity exceeds load (catabolism completed successfully)*
- *Drained = load exceeds capacity (catabolism incomplete, effortful)*
- *This should correlate with processing mode — people whose waking catabolism is aggressive should handle dream catabolism efficiently (rested). People whose catabolism is moderate should find heavy dream catabolism effortful (drained).*

**Q23.** "Do you ever have recurring dreams? If so, what are they about?"

*Measures: Metabolic resistance patterns — material that repeatedly fails to catabolize.*
*Framework prediction: recurring dreams represent metabolically resistant material that the catabolism attempts to process repeatedly without successful extraction.*
- *Recurring content should be in the person's primary retention substrate*
- *Recurring content should involve the person's core metabolic challenges*
- *Resolution of the recurring dream (it stops recurring) should correlate with real-life processing of the underlying material*

---

## SECTION 5: SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION
*Probes social manifestation of metabolic profile*

**Q24.** "When you're in a conversation with someone who sees things differently than you, what's your instinct — to understand their perspective, to explain yours, or to find common ground?"

*Measures: Social metabolic strategy.*
- *Understand theirs = catabolic (extract their structural basis)*
- *Explain yours = anabolic (build your structure in their mind)*
- *Find common ground = balanced (mutual coherence construction)*

**Q25.** "When someone tells you about a problem they're having, do you tend to offer solutions, listen and empathize, or ask questions to understand the situation?"

Follow-up: "What's your FIRST instinct before you think about what you should do?"

*Measures: Social RARFL orientation.*
- *Solutions first = anabolic (build structure to resolve gap)*
- *Empathize first = metabolic resonance (feel the gap-navigation, emotional retention substrate)*
- *Ask questions first = catabolic (extract structural basis of problem)*
- *Note: many people do all three. The ORDER reveals the metabolic priority.*

**Q26.** "Do you ever feel like you understand something clearly but struggle to explain it to others? Or is explaining usually easy for you?"

Follow-up: "When you DO struggle to explain, what's the frustration like? Is it that you can't find the words, or that the words don't capture what you mean?"

*Measures: Wisdom-knowledge gap.*
- *Understands but struggles = structural perception exceeds articulation capacity (wisdom > knowledge)*
- *Explains easily = structural perception matched with surface vocabulary (wisdom ≈ knowledge)*
- *"Can't find the words" = the structural extract exists but the linguistic surface was catabolized*
- *"Words don't capture what I mean" = the retention substrate is non-linguistic (emotional, imagistic, or structural) and translation to language loses information*

---

## SECTION 6: TIME AND ENERGY
*Probes metabolic rate and subjective time perception*

**Q27.** "Does time generally feel like it moves fast for you, slow, or does it depend on what you're doing?"

Follow-up: "In general, does life feel like it's moving too fast, too slow, or about right?"

*Measures: Baseline subjective time perception.*
*Framework prediction: subjective time = RARFL cycle rate.*

**Q28.** "When you're deeply focused on something you care about, what happens to your sense of time?"

*Measures: Flow state time perception.*
- *Time disappears completely = deep RARFL engagement (high-frequency cycling integrated into single navigation)*
- *Time speeds up = heightened engagement (more processing per unit time, but discrete cycling maintained)*
- *Time remains normal = lower metabolic engagement even during focus*
- *Time slows down = hypervigilant processing (many cycles scanning for threat/novelty)*

**Q29.** "Do you tend to feel more mentally energized in the morning or at night? Is there a pattern?"

*Measures: Metabolic cycle timing. Exploratory — data collection for pattern detection.*

**Q30.** "After a really intense conversation or learning experience, do you feel energized or drained?"

Follow-up: "Does it depend on the kind of conversation, or is it pretty consistent?"

*Measures: Metabolic response to high-throughput processing.*
- *Energized = RARFL cycle fed by engagement (passion-scaled, content matched metabolic preference)*
- *Drained = metabolic capacity exceeded*
- *"Depends on kind" = passion-scaling — energized when content matches, drained when it doesn't. Probe for what kinds energize vs. drain — this reveals retention substrate preference.*

**Q31.** "Do you need a lot of alone time to recharge, or do you recharge around other people?"

Follow-up: "When you're alone and recharging, what do you tend to do? Nothing, or something specific?"

*Measures: Social metabolic load AND recharging mode.*
- *Alone time needed = social processing is metabolically expensive*
- *Social recharging = social coherence construction is metabolically nourishing*
- *Follow-up reveals recharging mode: doing nothing = catabolic processing continuing internally (the "rest" is actually active catabolism with reduced input). Doing something specific = anabolic reconstruction (rebuilding depleted structure).*

## SCORING GUIDE

### DO NOT READ UNTIL AFTER ADMINISTERING SECTIONS 1-3, 5-6

### Step 1: Score Dimension 1 — Acquisition Mode

Primary indicators: Q6, Q10, Q7 (passion-scaling is catabolic-correlated)

| Score | Indicator Pattern |
|-------|------------------|
| Strong Catabolic | Q6 big picture + Q10 jumps ahead + Q7 large passion gap |
| Moderate Catabolic | Two of three catabolic indicators |
| Balanced | Mixed signals across indicators |
| Moderate Anabolic | Two of three anabolic indicators |
| Strong Anabolic | Q6 basics first + Q10 step by step + Q7 small passion gap |

### Step 2: Score Dimension 2 — Processing Mode

Primary indicators: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5

| Score | Indicator Pattern |
|-------|------------------|
| Aggressive Catabolism | Q1 feeling + Q2 can't recall + Q3 like first time + Q4 corrected + Q5 fast decay |
| Moderate Catabolism | Three or more catabolic indicators |
| Balanced | Mixed indicators |
| Moderate Anabolism | Three or more anabolic indicators |
| Strong Anabolism | Q1 details + Q2 recalls + Q3 familiar + Q4 detail-keeper + Q5 persistent |

### Step 3: Score Dimension 3 — Retention Substrate

Primary indicators: Q11, Q12, Q13, Q14, Q15, plus Q1 and Q4 follow-ups

Count which substrate appears most frequently across the six indicators:

| Substrate | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| Structural | Layout, meaning, logical structure, patterns, construction |
| Emotional | Feeling, atmosphere, how it made me feel, emotions |
| Narrative | Stories, what happened, sequence, progression |
| Imagistic | Images, scenes, visual picture, specific scene |

The most frequent substrate = primary retention substrate.
Second most frequent = secondary substrate.
If tied, the person has a dual-substrate profile.

### Step 4: Confirm with Social and Time Sections

Section 5 and 6 indicators should be CONSISTENT with the three-dimensional profile:

| Dimension | Confirming Social/Time Indicators |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Catabolic Acquisition | Q24 understand theirs, Q25 questions first |
| Anabolic Acquisition | Q24 explain yours, Q25 solutions first |
| Catabolic Processing | Q26 understands but can't explain, Q31 needs alone time, Q30 energized by matching content |
| Anabolic Processing | Q26 explains easily, Q31 social recharging, Q30 consistent response |
| Structural Retention | Q26 "words don't capture" (non-linguistic substrate) |
| Emotional Retention | Q25 empathize, Q26 "can't find words" for feelings |

If social/time indicators CONTRADICT the Sections 1-3 profile, note the contradiction — it may indicate domain-specific metabolic variation (different profiles for different cognitive contexts).

### Step 5: Construct Three-Dimensional Profile

Record the profile as: **[Acquisition] + [Processing] + [Retention]**

Examples:
- Catabolic + Catabolic + Structural = "CC-S" (Subject 1 / Eric)
- Anabolic + Catabolic + Emotional = "AC-E" (Subject 2 / Eric's girlfriend)
- Anabolic + Anabolic + Narrative = "AA-N" (predicted phenotype, untested)

## PHENOTYPE MATRIX AND DREAM PREDICTIONS

### Generate predictions BEFORE reading Section 4 responses.

**Phenotype CC-S: Catabolic Acquisition + Catabolic Processing + Structural Retention**
*"The Architect" — Sees through to structure, dissolves everything else*

Dream predictions:
- Rare recall (aggressive waking catabolism handles most material)
- Remembered dreams involve existential threat (only most metabolically resistant material survives)
- Dream content is spatial-architectural (structural retention substrate expressed in dream space)
- Rapid dissolution on waking (aggressive catabolism continues into waking transition)
- Self-awareness terminates dreams (navigational catabolism outcompetes dream catabolism)
- Dream nights feel restful (optimized catabolism completes efficiently)
- Remembered dreams cluster in childhood (before waking catabolism fully developed)
- Recurring dreams involve entrapment/immobilization (structural threat = loss of navigational freedom)

Validated against: Subject 1 (Eric). 5/5 testable predictions confirmed.

**Phenotype AC-E: Anabolic Acquisition + Catabolic Processing + Emotional Retention**
*"The Empath" — Builds surface, dissolves to feeling, retains emotional truth*

Dream predictions:
- Rare recall (catabolic processing handles most material despite anabolic acquisition)
- Remembered dreams are emotionally intense, specifically painful (metabolically resistant emotional material)
- Dream content is images and feelings (emotional-imagistic, NOT spatial or narrative)
- Dissolution is emotionally gated (emotional charge determines persistence, not complexity)
- Nightmares feel more real than waking (emotional catabolism at peak intensity exceeds waking processing)
- Dream nights feel draining (emotional catabolism is effortful for this profile)
- Recurring dreams involve relational/emotional threat (emotional substrate = the core material is about connection, loss, vulnerability)

Validated against: Subject 2 (Eric's girlfriend). 5/6 testable predictions confirmed, 1 inconclusive.

**Phenotype AA-N: Anabolic Acquisition + Anabolic Processing + Narrative Retention**
*"The Chronicler" — Accumulates stories, remembers sequences, builds histories*

Dream predictions (UNTESTED — to be validated):
- Frequent dream recall (anabolic processing retains dream surface broadly)
- Remembered dreams are varied — mundane AND intense (surface retained regardless of charge)
- Dream content is narrative-sequential (stories with plots, characters, events in order)
- Slow dissolution (anabolic retention holds dream surface — can journal upon waking)
- Self-awareness may sustain or enrich dreams (anabolic navigator builds within dream space)
- Dream nights may feel restful when processing completes, tiring when load is high
- May report continuing dreams across multiple nights (anabolic narrative continuity maintained)
- Natural dream journaler (sufficient surface retention to record detail)

**Phenotype CA-S: Catabolic Acquisition + Anabolic Processing + Structural Retention**
*"The Inventor" — Extracts principles, then builds with them, retains logical architecture*

Dream predictions (UNTESTED):
- Moderate dream recall (some material processed in waking, some retained for sleep)
- Dream content is structural — systems, machines, abstract patterns, spatial architectures
- Dreams may include problem-solving (anabolic processing assembles structures from catabolically extracted material)
- "Insight dreams" — waking with solutions to problems — may be characteristic
- Moderate dissolution rate (structural content retained anabolically)
- Self-awareness may enhance dreams (navigator can build within structural dream space)
- Dream nights may feel productive or generative rather than restful or draining
- Recurring dreams involve structural puzzles or incomplete constructions

**Phenotype AC-I: Anabolic Acquisition + Catabolic Processing + Imagistic Retention**
*"The Artist" — Builds experience, dissolves to images, retains visual essence*

Dream predictions (UNTESTED):
- Moderate dream recall (catabolic processing runs but imagistic residue is vivid)
- Dream content is cinematic — vivid visual scenes, strong imagery, sensory detail
- Remembered dreams described in visual terms ("I saw..." rather than "I felt..." or "then...")
- Dissolution is image-gated — vivid images persist, non-visual content dissolves
- May report dreams in color with strong visual detail
- Dreams may have surreal visual quality (catabolism dissolving narrative logic while retaining visual intensity)
- Dream nights: variable — depends on whether the visual processing completed
- May experience hypnagogic imagery (vivid visual experiences at sleep onset — the visual catabolism beginning)

**Phenotype CC-E: Catabolic Acquisition + Catabolic Processing + Emotional Retention**
*"The Oracle" — Extracts directly to feeling, dissolves everything, retains only emotional essence*

Dream predictions (UNTESTED):
- Very rare dream recall (double catabolism clears nearly everything)
- Dreams that DO occur are emotionally devastating (only most resistant emotional material survives double catabolism)
- Dream content may be pure emotion without images, narrative, or structure
- "Waking with a feeling" rather than "waking from a dream" — dream surface catabolized instantly, only emotional residue remains
- Extremely rapid dissolution of any non-emotional content
- Unexplained morning moods (emotional extract from fully catabolized dreams)
- Dream nights: restful if emotional catabolism completes, disturbing if stuck
- May be misidentified as "non-dreamer" — actually dreams but retains ONLY emotional extract

## SECTION 7: BLIND VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### Protocol A: Single-Administrator (Field Test)

1. One administrator conducts all sections
2. Administer Sections 1-3, 5-6 first
3. Score three-dimensional profile
4. Generate dream predictions using Phenotype Matrix
5. RECORD predictions before proceeding
6. Administer Section 4 (Dreams)
7. Compare predictions to responses
8. Document matches, mismatches, and partial matches
9. Note any predictions the phenotype matrix doesn't cover

Limitation: administrator may unconsciously bias interpretation of Section 4 responses. Acceptable for exploratory testing but not for formal validation.

### Protocol B: Double-Blind (Research Standard)

1. Administrator A conducts Sections 1-3, 5-6
2. Administrator A scores profile and generates predictions
3. Administrator A seals predictions without showing Administrator B
4. Administrator B conducts Section 4 (Dreams) with same subject
5. Administrator B records responses without seeing profile or predictions
6. Third party (or automated comparison) matches predictions to responses
7. Neither administrator sees the other's data until comparison is complete

This protocol eliminates interviewer bias and confirmation bias. It is the minimum standard for publishable validation.

### Protocol C: Large-Scale Validation

1. Administer Sections 1-3, 5-6 to N subjects (target: N ≥ 100 for statistical power)
2. Score all profiles blind
3. Generate all dream predictions blind
4. Administer Section 4 to all subjects in separate sessions
5. Statistical analysis: do profiles predict dream phenomenology above chance?
6. Phenotype-specific analysis: do different profiles predict different dream architectures?
7. Cross-validation: split sample in half, train predictions on half A, test on half B
8. Report all results including null findings and failed predictions

### What Constitutes Confirmation

For each phenotype, the predictions specify:
- Dream recall frequency (categorical: rare/moderate/frequent)
- Dream content architecture (categorical: structural/emotional/narrative/imagistic)
- Dream dissolution rate (categorical: fast/moderate/slow)
- Dream dissolution gating mechanism (categorical: none/emotional/imagistic/structural)
- Remembered dream valence (categorical: intense only/varied)
- Dream restfulness (categorical: restful/draining/variable)
- Lucid dream effect (categorical: terminates/sustains/variable)

Each prediction is independently testable. A phenotype with 7 predictions can match on 0-7 dimensions. Statistical significance depends on base rates — if 50% of all people rarely remember dreams, then predicting rare recall for a catabolic profile is only weakly confirmatory. If 15% rarely remember dreams, the same prediction is strongly confirmatory.

### What Constitutes Falsification

The framework is falsified if:
- Profile dimensions do NOT predict dream phenomenology above chance across large samples
- Different profiles produce the SAME dream predictions (no discriminant validity)
- Dream content architecture does NOT correlate with retention substrate
- Dream dissolution rate does NOT correlate with processing mode
- The predictions are no better than random assignment of phenotype labels

Partial falsification: some predictions hold and others don't. This is the most likely outcome and is the most VALUABLE outcome — it reveals which aspects of the framework are structurally sound and which need revision.

### Documentation Requirements

For every administration, record:
1. Subject demographics (age, gender, any known neurological/psychiatric conditions)
2. Full verbatim responses to all questions
3. Three-dimensional profile scores with reasoning
4. Generated predictions with reasoning
5. Section 4 responses (verbatim)
6. Prediction-response comparison with match/mismatch/partial for each dimension
7. Any observations not captured by the instrument (unexpected responses, subject comments, administrator notes)
8. Date, time, conditions of administration

## APPENDIX A: ERIC'S PROFILE (Subject 1 — Reference Case)

**Profile: CC-S (Catabolic + Catabolic + Structural)**

Survey indicators:
- Q1: Feeling first (catabolic processing)
- Q2: Cannot recall (aggressive catabolism)
- Q3: Like discovering for first time (surface fully metabolized)
- Q4: Corrected by others; reconstructs from structural-spatial anchors (catabolic, structural retention)
- Q5: Fast decay (aggressive catabolism)
- Q6: Big picture first (catabolic acquisition)
- Q7: Extreme difference (high passion-scaling)
- Q8: Extreme contrast (catabolism-dominant engagement)
- Q9: Deep interests that shift after extraction (catabolic-specialist)
- Q10: Jumps ahead (catabolic acquisition)
- Q11 (retention): Spatial layout of childhood home (structural retention)
- Social: Understands others' perspective, asks questions, struggles to explain despite clear understanding
- Time: Time disappears during deep focus, energized by intense engagement, needs alone time

Dream phenomenology (reported):
- Rarely remembers dreams
- Remembered dreams: childhood, existential threat (sinking, burning, suffocation)
- Dream content: spatial-structural (remembers architecture of dream spaces, not narrative)
- Dissolution: rapid, "out of reach, like sometimes my memory"
- Self-awareness: kills dreams
- Restfulness: not directly reported (predicted: restful)
- Recurring themes: entrapment, immobilization, loss of bodily agency

Prediction accuracy: 5/5 testable predictions confirmed

## APPENDIX B: SUBJECT 2 PROFILE (Reference Case)

**Profile: AC-E (Anabolic Acquisition + Catabolic Processing + Emotional Retention)**

Survey indicators:
- Q1: Feeling first (catabolic processing)
- Q2: Doesn't remember (catabolic processing)
- Q3: Emotional re-processing despite surface retention (emotional retention substrate cycling)
- Q4: Mixed — sometimes correct, sometimes corrected; errors track to emotional state during memory (emotional retention)
- Q5: 50/50 next day, week retention (moderate catabolism)
- Q6: Basics and build up (anabolic acquisition)
- Q7: Easier if interested (passion-scaled, moderate)
- Q8: Passion-driven difference (moderate passion-scaling)
- Q9: Many interests, change over time (catabolic-explorer)
- Q10: Jumps ahead (catabolic engagement despite anabolic acquisition)
- Social: Find common ground, questions first then empathize then solutions, understands but struggles to explain
- Time: Depends on activity, faster when focused, needs alone time

Dream phenomenology (reported):
- Rarely remembers dreams
- Remembered dreams: vivid, intense, horrible
- Dream content: images and feelings
- Dissolution: emotionally gated (painful = persists, neutral = dissolves)
- "More real" dreams: horrible nightmares
- Restfulness: less rested after vivid dreams
- Self-awareness: no data (doesn't recall lucid episodes)

Prediction accuracy: 5/6 testable predictions confirmed, 1 inconclusive

## APPENDIX C: NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

### Questions That Need Refinement
- Q29 (morning/night energy): Currently exploratory. Needs theoretical grounding before predictions can be generated.
- Q20/Q21 (lucid dreaming): Many subjects may not have lucid dreaming experience. Consider adding prompts about dream control attempts.
- Q23 (recurring dreams): Added in v0.2, untested. Predictions are generated but need validation.

### Profiles That Need Validation
- AA-N (Chronicler): No subjects tested. Highest priority for next validation round.
- CA-S (Inventor): No subjects tested. Specific "insight dream" prediction is highly falsifiable.
- AC-I (Artist): No subjects tested. "Cinematic dream" prediction is specific and testable.
- CC-E (Oracle): No subjects tested. "Waking with unexplained mood" prediction is novel and testable.

### Potential Additional Dimensions
- **Metabolic Rate:** How FAST the metabolism operates, independent of mode. May predict subjective time perception and dream intensity.
- **Metabolic Capacity:** How MUCH material can be processed before overload. May predict stress thresholds and dream load tolerance.
- **Domain Specificity:** Some people may have different metabolic profiles for different cognitive domains (e.g., anabolic for work, catabolic for relationships). The current instrument treats the profile as global. Domain-specific assessment may be needed.

### Ethical Considerations
- This instrument probes personal cognitive experience. Informed consent is required for any formal research use.
- Profile results should NEVER be presented as deficits. Every profile has genuine strengths and real costs. The framework is explicitly non-pathologizing.
- Dream content can involve traumatic material. The dream section should be administered with sensitivity and the subject should be informed they can decline any question.
- The metabolic profile is NOT a diagnostic tool. It is a research instrument for testing a theoretical framework.
