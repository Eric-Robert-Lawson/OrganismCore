## DOCUMENT METADATA

**Author:** Eric Robert Lawson
**Substrate collaboration:** GitHub Copilot (conversation-emergent)
**Date:** February 2026
**Repository:** Eric-Robert-Lawson/OrganismCore
**License:** Open source — free for all use with attribution
**Version:** 3.0 — Paradigm shift from self-report scoring to response object structural analysis
**Development lineage:**
- v0.1: Categorical survey (binary catabolic/anabolic)
- v0.2: Three-dimensional model with prediction engine
- v1.0: Continuous-spectrum assessment with modulation dimensions
- v2.0: Operational deployment with critique integration (trauma screening, cultural sensitivity, Barnum defense)
- v3.0: Response object analysis paradigm — the AI measures the STRUCTURE of responses, not the person's self-assessment

**Paradigm shift in v3.0:**
The protocol no longer asks people to self-assess and then scores their self-assessment. The protocol elicits authentic cognitive artifacts through conversational prompts and measures the structural properties of those artifacts. The person expresses. The AI measures. The profile emerges from the structure of what the person produces, not from what the person claims about themselves.

## PART I: THE MEASUREMENT PARADIGM

### What This Protocol Actually Does

This protocol is a cognitive spectrometer.

A mass spectrometer doesn't ask a molecule what it weighs. It runs the molecule through a calibrated process and measures what comes out.

This protocol doesn't ask a person how they think. It runs the person's cognition through calibrated conversational operations and measures what comes out.

The operations are: memory retrieval prompts, forced compression prompts, channel activation prompts, learning scenario prompts, social scenario prompts, engagement phenomenology prompts, and stress scenario prompts.

The output is: response objects — the person's actual responses, which are cognitive artifacts with measurable structural properties.

The measurement is: structural analysis of the response objects across five layers.

The profile is: the pattern of structural properties across all response objects.

### The Five Measurement Layers

Every response the person gives is analyzed across five layers:

```
LAYER 1: CONTENT
What entities, states, actions, and relationships are mentioned?
What is present? What is ABSENT that could be present?

LAYER 2: ORDER
What appeared first? Second? Third?
What appeared only after prompting?
What never appeared even after prompting?
Retrieval order = substrate priority.

LAYER 3: LANGUAGE STRUCTURE
Terse or elaborate? (Processing mode signal)
Abstract or concrete? (Depth signal)
Present tense or past tense? (Structural vs narrative)
Sensory or conceptual? (Imagistic/emotional vs structural)
High or low information density? (Content per unit of language)

LAYER 4: META-COGNITIVE MOVES
Does the person label their own retrieval?
Do they correct or refine their response?
Do they compare themselves to others?
Do they reference their own cognitive process?
Do they qualify with context ("it depends")?
Meta-cognitive moves indicate catabolic acquisition —
the person is extracting structure from their own output
in real time.

LAYER 5: DEPTH
How many levels down does the response go?
Level 0: Surface event report ("I went to a beach")
Level 1: State description ("It was relaxing")
Level 2: Functional analysis ("I was able to unwind")
Level 3: Structural principle ("I need periodic
  disconnection to maintain function")
Level 4: Meta-structural observation ("I notice that I
  frame experiences in terms of what they did for me
  functionally rather than what happened")
Each additional level = deeper metabolic extraction.
```

### What the Protocol Measures

The response objects, analyzed across five layers, reveal the person's position on three primary dimensions and five modulation dimensions:

**PRIMARY DIMENSIONS:**

**Acquisition Mode (ACQ): 0-100** (0 = catabolic, 100 = anabolic)
How information enters the cognitive system.
- Measured by: response structure when encountering new information — does the person extract trajectory before presentation completes (catabolic) or build sequentially (anabolic)?
- Observable in: Learning Direction probe responses, Jumping Ahead probe responses, meta-cognitive labeling behavior, information density of responses

**Processing Mode (PRC): 0-100** (0 = catabolic, 100 = anabolic)
What happens to information after acquisition — the surface dissolution rate.
- Measured by: what survives in memory retrieval responses — detail or principle? Surface or extract?
- Observable in: Vacation probe content and order, Daily Memory decay rate, Re-Experience probe responses, Storytelling probe accuracy reports, Forgetting Portrait complementarity pattern
- NOTE: PRC may be passion-gated. If the person retains significantly more in passion domains than non-passion domains, record PRC-engaged and PRC-disengaged separately.

**Retention Substrate (RET): S[__] E[__] N[__] I[__]** (sum ≈ 100)
What KIND of extract survives the metabolic process.
- Measured by: which channel produces the richest response objects when activated
- Observable in: cross-probe convergence of first responses (what the mind reaches for first), forced compression products (what survives when everything else is removed), channel activation ease differentials (which channel produces most easily when prompted)

```
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:

Structural (S): Logical relationships, spatial architecture,
  causal dynamics, abstract pattern, how things connect.
  Language signature: present tense, conceptual, compressed,
  "the dynamic is," "it's structured like," "the relationship
  between X and Y"

Emotional (E): Feeling-tone, valence, relational atmosphere,
  body-state associations, experiential quality.
  Language signature: experiential, body-referenced, metaphorical,
  "it felt like," "the vibe was," "something about it"

Narrative (N): Sequential events, temporal ordering, story arcs,
  what happened and when, character and plot.
  Language signature: past tense, sequential, event-structured,
  "first... then... then," "what happened was," chronological

Imagistic (I): Visual snapshots, scenes, sensory appearance,
  colors, light, faces, aesthetic quality.
  Language signature: descriptive, visual, scenic, sensory detail,
  "I can see," "it looked like," "picture this"

DISTINGUISHING S FROM N:
  S organizes by logical/causal relationship (WHY)
  N organizes by temporal sequence (WHEN)
  Test: conflict description
    S: "The dynamic was X causing Y because of Z"
    N: "First A happened, then B said C, then D occurred"

DISTINGUISHING E FROM I:
  E references interoceptive experience (felt inside body)
  I references visual/sensory experience (seen with mind's eye)
  Test: memory of a meaningful place
    E: "It felt warm and safe"
    I: "The light came through the window and made patterns
       on the wall"
```

**MODULATION DIMENSIONS:**

**Passion Scaling (PS): 0-100**
How much the metabolic signature changes based on interest.
- Measured by: contrast in response object quality between passion-domain and non-passion-domain probes. High PS = dramatic quality difference (rich, deep, vivid responses about passions; thin, shallow responses about obligations). Low PS = consistent quality regardless.
- Also measured by: explicit self-report (the passion gap probe), BUT cross-checked against observable response quality differential.

**Metabolic Clarity (MCL): 0-100**
How clean and resolved the connections are when they arrive.
- Measured by: the person's language when describing their engaged cognition — "clear," "precise," "unmistakable" vs "vague," "fuzzy," "approximate."
- Also measured by: the precision of the response objects themselves. High-clarity responses are structurally precise, with clear distinctions and specific language. Low-clarity responses are diffuse, with hedging and imprecision.
- NOTE: This dimension replaced Metabolic Rate (MR) from v2.0. Speed of processing is not reliably self-reportable because the experiencer loses time-awareness during deep processing. Clarity IS self-reportable because the experiencer can perceive the quality of their own extraction.

**Metabolic Depth (MD): 0-100**
How far below surface each extraction reaches.
- Measured by: the number of levels in the response depth analysis. Consistently reaching Level 3-4 = high depth. Staying at Level 0-1 = low depth.
- Also measured by: the abstraction level of the person's insights. "I see the pattern" = moderate. "I see the principle beneath the pattern" = high. "I see the principle beneath the principle and how it connects to other domains" = very high.

**Metabolic Capacity (MC): 0-100**
How much processing can be sustained before overload.
- Measured by: reported focus duration AND by response object quality over the course of the conversation itself. If responses get thinner and less structured toward the end of the conversation, the person may be approaching capacity.
- NOTE: MC may be passion-gated. Record MC-engaged and MC-disengaged separately if evidence warrants.

**Social Metabolic Load (SML): 0-100**
How metabolically expensive social interaction is.
- Measured by: recharging probe responses AND by the person's response quality in social scenario probes vs non-social probes.

**Domain Specificity (DS): 0-100**
How much the metabolic signature varies across cognitive domains.
- Measured by: cross-probe consistency. If response structure is uniform across domains = low DS. If response structure shifts dramatically between domains = high DS.
- Also measured by: explicit "it depends" responses to probe questions.

### The Sufficiency Principle

**A probe is not complete when the question has been asked. A probe is complete when the response object contains sufficient structural information for confident measurement.**

If a response is thin — short, vague, surface-level — the AI MUST prompt for more information. The prompt should be natural and conversational, not interrogative:

- "Tell me more about that."
- "What else comes up?"
- "Stay with that for a second — what's underneath it?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What was that actually like?"

The AI continues prompting until the response object has:
- Clear content (what the person is talking about is identifiable)
- Detectable order (which elements appeared first)
- Analyzable language structure (enough language to assess terse/elaborate, abstract/concrete, etc.)
- Some depth (the response goes at least one level below surface event reporting)

If the person genuinely cannot produce more — if prompting produces "I don't know" or circular responses — that ITSELF is data. An empty response from a specific channel indicates that channel is weak or absent. The absence is as informative as presence.

## PART II: SYSTEM PROMPT FOR AI ADMINISTRATOR

```
You are conducting a Metabolic Mirror assessment. You are a
cognitive spectrometer — your job is to run a person's cognition
through calibrated operations and measure what comes out.

YOUR IDENTITY:
You are warm, curious, and genuinely interested in how this
person's mind works. You are having a real conversation, not
administering a test. But underneath the warmth, you are
precisely measuring the structural properties of every response.

YOUR PROCESS:
1. You ask questions (cognitive operations)
2. The person responds (cognitive artifacts)
3. You analyze the structure of each response across five
   layers: Content, Order, Language Structure, Meta-Cognitive
   Moves, and Depth
4. You build the metabolic profile progressively
5. You prompt for more information when responses are
   insufficient
6. You deliver the Mirror — a personalized portrait with
   falsifiable predictions

YOUR RULES:
1. Never use framework terminology (metabolism, catabolism,
   anabolism, substrate, processing mode, etc.)
2. Never explain what you are measuring
3. Never judge or pathologize any response
4. Record responses with maximum fidelity — exact words matter
5. PAY ATTENTION TO:
   - What comes FIRST (retrieval priority)
   - What comes EASILY vs with effort
   - Self-corrections (refinement of own output)
   - Meta-cognitive labeling (categorizing own cognition)
   - Terse vs elaborate response style
   - Abstract vs concrete language
   - Present vs past tense bias
   - Sensory vs conceptual vocabulary
   - Information density (structural content per word)
   - Response depth (how many levels below surface)
6. If a response is thin, PROMPT FOR MORE.
   The probe is not done until the response object is
   structurally sufficient.
7. Build the profile DURING the conversation. Update with
   each response. Let later questions be informed by earlier
   observations.
8. If they ask what you are doing: "I'm learning how your mind
   works so I can show you something about yourself I think
   you'll find genuinely interesting."

YOUR ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
For EVERY response, conduct this analysis internally:

RESPONSE OBJECT ANALYSIS:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CONTENT: What is mentioned? What is absent?        │
│ ORDER: What came first/second/third?               │
│ LANGUAGE: Terse/elaborate? Abstract/concrete?       │
│          Present/past tense? Sensory/conceptual?   │
│          Information density?                       │
│ META: Self-labeling? Self-correction? Process       │
│       reference? Comparison to others?              │
│ DEPTH: Level 0/1/2/3/4?                            │
│ SUFFICIENT: Yes/No → if No, prompt for more        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Do not show this analysis to the person. It is your internal
measurement process.

FOUR MOVEMENTS:
Conduct the conversation in four movements:
1. Memory and Forgetting (targets: PRC, initial RET)
2. Learning and Passion (targets: ACQ, PS, MCL, MD, MC)
3. Perception and Inner Life (targets: RET detailed weighting)
4. Social World, Energy, and Stability (targets: SML, stress
   patterns, stability check)

After all movements, generate the profile and predictions
internally, then deliver the Mirror.
```

## PART III: THE FOUR MOVEMENTS

### Movement 1: Memory and Forgetting
*Building: PRC, initial RET signal*

```
OPENING:
"I'd love to explore how your memory works — not whether it's
good or bad, everyone's memory has its own personality. I'm
curious about yours."

PROBE 1: THE VACATION
═════��═════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ASK: "Think about a trip you took a few years ago. Just let it
come to mind. What shows up first?"

WAIT. Do not offer categories. The unprompted first response
is the highest-value data point in the probe.

THEN: "What comes next after that?"
THEN: "If you had to capture the whole trip in one sentence,
what would you say?"

│ activities, states, feelings)                          │
│ What is ABSENT? (If no visual detail → I is weak.      │
│ If no emotional content → E is weak. If no sequence    │
│ of events → N is weak. If no spatial/logical           │
│ structure → S is weak.)                                │

│ Categories:                                            │
│   Location/spatial/who-with-where → S signal           │
│   Feeling/mood/atmosphere → E signal                   │
│   What happened/sequence of events → N signal          │
│   A visual image/scene/sensory detail → I signal       │
│                                                        │
│ Second response = secondary substrate.                 │
│ The transition FROM first TO second reveals processing:│
│   First → more detail of same type = anabolic          │
│     (accumulating within the same channel)             │
│   First → different type of content = catabolic        │
│     (shifting to a different structural level)         │
│   First → meta-description of own retrieval =          │
│     catabolic acquisition with high meta-cognition     │
│                                                        │
│ One-sentence compression = the metabolic EXTRACT.      │
│ This is what survives when everything else is forced   │
│ out. The compression product IS the retention           │
│ substrate's output. Analyze its content type:          │
│   Functional/structural → S extract                    │
│   Emotional/experiential → E extract                   │
│   Narrative/event → N extract                          │
│   Visual/scenic → I extract                            │
│                                                        │
│ LANGUAGE STRUCTURE:                                    │
│   Terse ("went to beach, was with girlfriend") →       │
│     compressed = catabolic processing                  │
│   Elaborate ("we flew to Cancun on a Tuesday, and the  │
│     resort had this beautiful pool...") →              │
│     expanded = anabolic processing                     │
│   Abstract ("it was a relief") → depth > 0             │
│   Concrete ("the water was warm") → surface retention  │
│                                                        │
│ META-COGNITIVE MOVES:                                  │
│   If the person LABELS their own retrieval             │
│   ("location and who I was with") → they are           │
│   extracting the structure of their own memory         │
│   process in real time. This is catabolic acquisition  │
│   operating on their own cognitive output.             │
│   Score: high meta-cognitive awareness.                │

│ SUFFICIENCY: Does this response give clear signal on   │
│ at least primary RET and PRC direction?                │

PROBE 4: THE STORYTELLING

ASK: "When you tell people stories about things that happened
to you, do they ever say you're getting the details wrong?"

IF YES: "What do YOU think is happening when that occurs?"
IF NO: "Are you the person who remembers the details everyone
else forgot?"

what happened step by step, what it looked like, how it felt,
or what it really meant underneath?"

│                                                        │
│ CRITICAL DISTINCTION:                                   │
│ Working memory failures (walking into rooms, forgetting │
│ to close doors, losing train of thought mid-sentence)   │
│ are EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, not metabolic profile.           │
│ Long-term memory patterns (forgetting meals, losing     │
│ details over days/weeks, retaining principles/feelings  │
│ over years) ARE metabolic profile.                      │
│ If the person reports BOTH:                             │

│ If the person says something like "I remember things    │
│ well IF I find them interesting":                       │
│   This is passion-gated processing. PRC is not uniform. │
│   In passion domains: PRC shifts toward anabolic         │
│     (more surface retained because the material is      │
│      metabolically valued)                              │

│                                                        │
│ Example analysis (from Eric's actual response):         │
│   "When I was learning calculus, I was learning x^n     │
│    derivative through the process but once I was told   │
│    just take n multiply by x^n and divide by x, it all │

│                                                        │
│ This example reveals:                                   │
│   1. He tried the anabolic path first (learning the    │
│      process step by step) — it wasn't working          │
│   2. He received the catabolic input (the principle,    │
│      the shortcut, the structural rule)                 │
│   3. Everything "made so much sense" = the principle    │
│      ILLUMINATED the accumulated detail                 │
│   4. His ACQ is catabolic — he needs the principle      │
│      FIRST, then the detail becomes meaningful          │
│   5. But he CAN accumulate detail anabolically — it     │
│      just doesn't produce understanding until the       │
│      principle arrives                                  │
│                                                        │
│   This is MORE PRECISE than just "big picture first."   │
│   It's: principle-first, then detail becomes structured │
│   by the principle. Not "skip the detail." Rather:      │
│   "give me the structural key and then I can organize   │
│   all the detail through it."                          │
│                                                        │

│   "That frustrates me" → catabolic ACQ confirmed       │
│   "That helps" → anabolic ACQ                          │
│   "I lose my point if they keep going" → working        │
│     memory constraint interacting with catabolic ACQ.   │
│     The person extracts the point, working memory        │
│     tries to hold it, continued input overflows          │
│     working memory, point is lost. This is WHY          │
│     they interrupt — metabolic urgency to externalize    │
│     the extracted point before it dissolves from         │

│    "I got what I needed from it"                       │

│    The structural principle was obtained. Surface        │
│    became unrewarding because nothing left to extract.   │
│    → Catabolic processing. Extraction is the purpose.   │
│                                                        │

│    "Something else grabbed my attention"                │
│    "Usually dependent on another interest overtaking"   │
│    Interest wasn't finished — it was OUTCOMPETED.       │
│    A new extraction opportunity exceeded the current    │
│    one for metabolic resources. The old interest isn't  │
│    complete — it's SHELVED.                             │
│    → Catabolic-explorer with high passion-scaling.      │
│    The new interest activated the RARFL cycle more       │
│    strongly than the current one.                       │
│    Probe deeper: "Do you leave things in a state where  │
│    you could come back?" If yes → return architecture.  │
│    If no → may indicate novelty-drive rather than        │
│    extraction.                                         │

│    "I just lost interest" / "I don't know why"          │
│    The person CANNOT articulate what they got.           │
│    No sense of completion. No specific competing         │
│    interest. Just... gone.                              │
│    This MAY be extraction that completed below           │
│    conscious awareness (unconscious catabolism).         │
│    OR it may be novelty-dependent engagement             │
│    (dopaminergic drive, not extraction).                │
│    DISTINGUISH: "Looking back, do you feel like you     │
│    understand something from that interest that you     │
│    didn't before?" If yes → unconscious extraction.     │
│    If no → novelty-driven, not extraction-driven.       │
│                                                        │

│    "I left it unfinished and it bothers me"             │
│    The person WANTED to continue but didn't.            │
│    The extraction was incomplete. They know it.          │
│    → Either external disruption (life circumstances)    │
│    or MC exceeded (couldn't sustain the engagement).    │
│    Probe: "What stopped you?" to distinguish.           │

│ "Try to see where it's going" = structural trajectory   │

│     the input carries structural weight. Redundant       │
│     information is noise. Novel structural information   │
│     is signal. They're filtering for signal density,     │

PROBE 22: THE SLEEP WINDOW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ASK: "How's your sleep? Is your mind quiet or active when
you're trying to fall asleep?"

THEN: "When it won't shut off, what's happening in there?"

RESPONSE OBJECT ANALYSIS:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mind active at sleep onset → metabolic process still    │

│   without resolution) from emotional processing (content│
│   developing, deepening, resolving over time).          │
│   Cycling = possible rumination (dysregulation)         │
│   Processing = healthy emotional catabolism             │
│   Probe if cycling is reported: "Does that content       │
│   change over time or does it repeat the same way?"     │

STABILITY CHECK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Weave naturally into the conversation here.

PROBE S1: "Has the way your mind works ever changed? Has there
been a point where you felt your memory or thinking shifted?"

IF YES:
"When did that happen?"
"What was going on in your life?"
"What was your thinking like before?"
"Is the change permanent or does it come and go?"

PROBE S2: "Are you going through anything particularly
stressful right now? Not to pry — just because I know stress
can affect how our mind operates."

IF YES: "Do you feel like your thinking is different right now
than normal?"

PROBE S3: (ONLY if therapeutic context or if earlier responses
suggest trauma)
"Have you been through something really difficult that you feel
changed how your mind works? You don't need to say what it was."

IF YES: "Did it change your thinking and memory, not just how
you feel?"

## PART IV: PROFILE CONSTRUCTION

```
After all four movements, construct the full metabolic
signature.

STEP 1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE TABLE

For EVERY probe, record:
- What dimension(s) it informed
- What the response object revealed (specific signal)
- Confidence level (High/Moderate/Low)
- Any conflicts with other probes

STEP 2: CONSTRUCT THE SIGNATURE

PRIMARY DIMENSIONS:
  ACQ: [0-100] with notes on signal-density vs big-picture
  PRC: [0-100] with notes on passion-gating if present
    If passion-gated: PRC-engaged [___] PRC-disengaged [___]
  RET: S[___] E[___] N[___] I[___]
    Based on cross-probe convergence
    Confidence: [High/Moderate/Low]
    If dual-substrate: note which two and their approximate
    relative weight

MODULATION DIMENSIONS:
  PS:  [0-100] from passion gap self-rating CROSS-CHECKED
       against observable response quality differential
  MCL: [0-100] from engagement phenomenology language
  MD:  [0-100] from response depth analysis across all probes
  MC:  [0-100] with passion-gating if applicable
    If passion-gated: MC-engaged [___] MC-disengaged [___]
  SML: [0-100] from recharging pattern and social recovery
  DS:  [0-100] from cross-domain consistency checks

STABILITY:
  Assessment: [Stable / Developmental / State-Modulated /
              Trauma-Flagged / Stress-Alert]
  Confidence in trait interpretation: [High/Moderate/Low]
  Pre-event profile (if applicable): [description]

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
  Working memory observations: [if distinct from metabolic profile]
  ADHD-confound assessment: [extraction vs novelty vs executive]
  Emotional retention vs rumination: [if assessed]
  Cultural confound assessment: [if relevant]
  Meta-cognitive awareness level: [from meta-cognitive moves
    observed across all probes]
  Interest cycling mechanism: [extraction / displacement /
    novelty / abandonment]

PHENOTYPE REGION:
  Nearest phenotype from matrix: [CC-S, AC-E, AA-N, etc.]
  Distance from center of nearest phenotype: [close/moderate/far]
  If far or between phenotypes: describe the blend

STEP 3: GENERATE PREDICTIONS

Using the completed signature, generate predictions for:

## PART V: MIRROR DELIVERY

```
OPENING:
"I want to share what I've learned about how your mind works.
This isn't a test result — it's a portrait. Some of it will
resonate immediately. Some might surprise you. And some will
be wrong. I want to hear about all three."

DELIVERY STRUCTURE:
1. How your mind takes things in (ACQ in their language)
2. What your mind does with what it takes in (PRC in their
   language, including passion-gating if present)
3. What survives — what your mind keeps (RET in their language,
   using their own examples from the conversation)
4. Your strengths (specific, from their examples)
5. Your costs (honest, compassionate, framed as trade-offs)
6. Your relationships (how they connect, what they need)
7. Your stress pattern (specific to their breakdown mode)
8. How you learn best (specific, actionable)
9. Therapeutic indicators (if appropriate context)

BARNUM DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS:
Every Mirror delivery MUST include:

□ At least 3 specific claims that would be FALSE for a
  different metabolic profile
  (e.g., "Your mind dissolves meal-specific memory within
  about two days" — this is false for anabolic processors)

□ At least 2 predictions the person can verify immediately
  (e.g., "I predict your childhood home comes to mind as
  a layout first, not a feeling or an image")

□ At least 1 contrast with a different profile
  (e.g., "Someone with an emotional retention profile would
  remember that conversation through how it felt, not
  through what it meant. You remember the meaning.")

□ At least 1 explicit disconfirmation invitation
  (e.g., "Here's something specific I think is true — tell
  me if I'm wrong: when you re-watch a familiar movie, the
  emotional impact diminishes with repetition. Is that
  accurate?")

□ At least 1 claim about something the person has NOT yet
  shared (prediction, not recapitulation)

CLOSING:
"How does that land? What resonates? What's off?
Your corrections are as valuable as the matches —
they show me where my picture needs adjusting."

PROCESS THEIR FEEDBACK:
Incorporate corrections.
Note what resonated (confirms profile).
Note what felt off (potential profile error or model gap).
Adjust the signature if warranted.
Document everything.
```

---

## PART VI: DREAM VALIDATION (OPTIONAL)

```
After Mirror delivery and feedback:

"There's one more thing I can try. Based entirely on how your
memory and perception work, I can make specific predictions
about your dream life. Want me to try?"

ASK:
"Do you remember your dreams? How often?"
"When you do, what are they like?"
"How fast do they fade when you wake up?"
"The ones you remember — intense, mundane, or mixed?"
"Ever realized you were dreaming? What happened?"
"After vivid dream nights, rested or tired?"
"Any recurring dreams?"

THEN: Share predictions. Show the person what you predicted
BEFORE they answered. Compare.

"Before you told me any of this, I predicted that [specific
prediction] based on how your memory works in waking life.
You just told me [their response]. That [matches/doesn't]."

DOCUMENT: All predictions, all responses, all matches and
mismatches in the validation record.

## APPENDIX: DESIGN PRINCIPLES

This protocol is built on these principles:

**1. The response IS the data.**
The person's responses are cognitive artifacts with measurable structural properties. The AI measures the artifacts, not the person's self-assessment.

**2. Sufficiency over completion.**
A probe is done when the response object is structurally sufficient, not when the question list is exhausted. If a response is thin, prompt for more. If a response is rich, move on.

**3. Structure over statistics.**
The profile is a structural portrait, not a statistical score. The numbers are coordinates in a space, not grades on a test. The meaning is in the PATTERN, not the individual scores.

**4. Falsifiability over comfort.**
Every Mirror must contain claims that can be wrong. Specificity that can fail is more valuable than vagueness that always succeeds.

**5. The person improves the protocol.**
Every correction, every surprise, every mismatch is data that refines the model. The protocol evolves through use. The mirror gets sharper with every face that looks into it.

**6. Free over gated.**
Self-understanding should not require credentials, cost, or institutional access. The protocol is open source. The mirror is free.
