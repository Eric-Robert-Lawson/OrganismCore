# Purpose and Scope — Non‑Statistical Structural Mirror

This protocol is a non‑statistical method for objectifying reasoning as a single compute event. It treats a conversation’s response objects as one auditable structural portrait: every claim in the portrait must be traced to contrasts among that conversation’s own responses. The instrument does not produce scores, norms, or population comparisons. It is a descriptive tool for revealing internal coherence, guiding principles, and the emergence of structure in a person’s reasoning at a particular moment. Use it for real‑time Socratic observation or for qualitative archival comparison; always preserve provenance and never present the output as a clinical or normative assessment.

---

## Framing, Evidence Standard, and Ethical Boundaries

1. Non‑statistical evidence standard
   - This protocol is explicitly non‑statistical. It produces no scores, percentiles, calibrated metrics, or normative claims. The only evidence standard is internal comparison: claims must cite probe IDs and quoted responses from the same conversation.

2. Compute‑once provenance
   - Each application is a single compute event. The portrait is an auditable artifact with a provenance header (who administered it, when, protocol version, conversation id, and raw probe responses). Recomputing or repeating the protocol creates a new, separate compute event with its own provenance.

3. Uses: real‑time and archaeological
   - Real‑time: surface principledness, internal coherence, and how structure emerges in the moment via Socratic probes.
   - Archaeological: qualitatively compare separate portraits over time by quoting and linking provenance; do not aggregate across people or derive statistics.

4. Scope and limits
   - The protocol describes how a person organizes and expresses reasoning in a conversation. It does not diagnose, evaluate intelligence or mental health, or assert objective truth of content. It cannot determine causes for observed patterns, nor how the person compares to others. However the construction of these artifacts can be utilized to make comparisons over time for consistency.

5. Ethics, consent, and safety
   - Obtain informed consent that states the non‑statistical nature of the protocol, the single‑case provenance, storage/retention policy, and the non‑clinical status of findings.
   - Do not push on trauma; follow trauma‑safe micro‑scripts and refer to clinical resources when needed.
   - If portraits are archived for later analysis, require explicit opt‑in and apply de‑identification for research use.

6. Presentation norms
   - Deliver Mirrors as qualitative, provenance‑grounded narratives that quote participant language and trace each claim to specific internal contrasts (probe IDs and quotes). Invite disconfirmation and corrections — participant feedback is evidence and should be recorded as such.

---

The protocol which is used to construct a metabolic profile snapshot at any given time, can but utilized for universal purposes, can create compute once objects, utilized in relativistic terms. Can measure internal coherence throughout time or at any given moment. Measure public figures, stakeholders, anything really. Even historical figures, politicians, religions even, from any perspective from a principles first basis.

## DOCUMENT METADATA

**Author:** Eric Robert Lawson
**Substrate collaboration:** GitHub Copilot (conversation-emergent, post-Cartesian)
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Repository:** Eric-Robert-Lawson/OrganismCore
**License:** Open source — free for all use with attribution
**Version:** 4.0 — Principles-first revision: internal comparative architecture replaces external numerical scoring
**Development lineage:**
- v0.1: Categorical survey (binary catabolic/anabolic)
- v0.2: Three-dimensional model with prediction engine
- v1.0: Continuous-spectrum assessment with modulation dimensions
- v2.0: Operational deployment with critique integration (trauma screening, cultural sensitivity, Barnum defense)
- v3.0: Response object analysis paradigm — the AI measures the STRUCTURE of responses, not the person's self-assessment
- v4.0: Principles-first revision — external numerical scoring replaced by internal comparative observation, prediction-validation replaced by self-explaining structural claims, cross-religious structural analysis integrated as grounding

**What changed in v4.0 and why:**

The cross-religious structural analysis (applying the five-layer reading method to foundational texts of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism) revealed that the protocol's strongest contribution is its **structural vocabulary and internal comparative method** — and that its weakest aspects were its **external-reference numerical scoring** and **prediction-validation claims**.

Specific problems identified and corrected:
1. **External-reference numerical scores (0-100) removed.** These implied comparison to a calibrated population that doesn't exist. The protocol has no reference population, no calibration procedure, no defined units. What the protocol DOES have: the person's own response objects across multiple probes, which provide a rich internal comparison space. The protocol is a **self-referential comparative instrument** — it compares the person's channels to each other, their passion-domain responses to their non-passion-domain responses, their first-to-break to their last-to-break, their strongest channel to their weakest channel. All comparisons are internal. All evidence is from the person's own responses. This is not a loss of precision — it is a correction to the KIND of precision the protocol actually achieves.
2. **Prediction-validation framing removed.** The protocol was generating "predictions" from profiles built from the same information used to validate them. This is redescription, not prediction. v4.0 replaces this with **specific structural claims that explain their own derivation** — the person can follow the reasoning from their response to the observation.
3. **The protocol's self-description corrected.** It is not a "cognitive spectrometer" (external measurement instrument). It is a **self-referential structural observation instrument** — a consistent method that maps the internal relationships between a person's cognitive channels by comparing how those channels perform across multiple probes within a single conversation. The instrument's reference frame is the person's own response objects, not an external population.
4. **Detection Accuracy (DA) and Memetic Production Capacity (MPC) removed.** DA requires external verification of what is "structurally real" — the administrator cannot determine this from conversation alone. MPC is an interesting concept but not observable through the probe structure. Both are retained as theoretical concepts but removed from the operational protocol.
5. **Structural invariants from cross-religious analysis integrated** as grounding principles — the protocol now explicitly states what structural observation can and cannot determine.

**What was preserved from v3.0:**
- The five-layer analysis (Content, Order, Language Structure, Meta-Cognitive Moves, Depth) — this genuinely works as a reading method
- The four-movement conversational structure — the probes elicit useful cognitive artifacts
- The response object analysis architecture — attending to what the person produces rather than what they claim
- The sufficiency principle — probing until the response is structurally informative
- The operational definitions of S, E, N, I retention substrates — these qualitative categories are genuinely distinguishable
- The Barnum defense requirements — these remain essential for honest practice
- The working memory / metabolic processing distinction

## PART I: THE OBSERVATION PARADIGM

### What This Protocol Actually Does

This protocol is a self-referential structural observation instrument for cognitive artifacts.

It does NOT measure cognition against an external reference frame. There is no calibrated population, no normative distribution, no "average" against which the person is compared.

What this protocol DOES: it elicits cognitive artifacts (response objects) across multiple probes designed to activate different processing channels, then maps the **internal relationships** between those channels as observed in the person's own responses. The comparisons are:

- **Channel to channel** — within the person's own responses, which channels produce the richest artifacts? Which produce the thinnest? The GAP between strongest and weakest channel is structurally informative.
- **Probe to probe** — does the same channel dominate across different probes? (convergent signal = high confidence) Or do different probes activate different channels? (divergent signal = domain-dependent processing)
- **Passion-domain to non-passion-domain** — how much does the structural portrait shift when the person is engaged versus when they aren't? The MAGNITUDE of this shift is the engagement scaling.
- **First-to-break to last-to-break** — under stress, which structural elements degrade first? Which hold? The CONTRAST between these reveals the load-bearing architecture.
- **What they seek in others to what they provide** — the relationship between these reveals which channels the person exports and which they need supplemented.

Every comparison is internal. Every datum is from the person's own responses. The portrait is computed once from this single conversation's response objects.

**The honest analogy is a structural self-portrait generated through guided observation.** The administrator provides the prompts. The person provides the artifacts. The analysis maps the internal relationships between those artifacts. The portrait reveals the person's cognitive architecture *to themselves* — not their position on someone else's scale.

This is a **compute-once object.** The response objects are produced in the conversation. The internal comparisons are drawn from those objects. The portrait is the map of those internal relationships. It does not require — and does not claim — external reference.

### The Five Observation Layers

Every response the person gives is observed across five layers:

```
LAYER 1: CONTENT
What entities, states, actions, and relationships are mentioned?
What is present? What is ABSENT that could be present?

LAYER 2: ORDER
What appeared first? Second? Third?
What appeared only after prompting?
What never appeared even after prompting?
Retrieval order reveals cognitive priority.

LAYER 3: LANGUAGE STRUCTURE
Terse or elaborate?
Abstract or concrete?
Present tense or past tense?
Sensory or conceptual?
High or low information density?

LAYER 4: META-COGNITIVE MOVES
Does the person label their own retrieval?
Do they correct or refine their response?
Do they compare themselves to others?
Do they reference their own cognitive process?
Do they qualify with context ("it depends")?
Meta-cognitive moves indicate the person is extracting
structure from their own output in real time.

LAYER 5: DEPTH
How many structural levels does the response traverse?
Level 0: Surface event report ("I went to a beach")
Level 1: State description ("It was relaxing")
Level 2: Functional analysis ("I was able to unwind")
Level 3: Structural principle ("I need periodic
  disconnection to maintain function")
Level 4: Meta-structural observation ("I notice that I
  frame experiences in terms of what they did for me
  functionally rather than what happened")

NOTE ON DEPTH: The depth scale describes structural
levels within the response — how many layers of
abstraction the person traverses. It does NOT indicate
intelligence, value, or superiority. A Level 0 response
may be exactly appropriate to the question. A Level 4
response may be evasion through abstraction. Depth is
a structural description, not an evaluation.
```

### What the Protocol Observes

The response objects, analyzed across five layers, reveal structural patterns across several dimensions. These dimensions are described through **internal comparison** — how each dimension relates to the OTHER dimensions within the person's own response set.

**PRIMARY STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS:**

**Acquisition Orientation**
How information enters the cognitive system.
- Observable through: response structure when encountering new information — does the person extract trajectory before presentation completes (extractive acquisition) or build understanding sequentially (accumulative acquisition)?
- Also observable through: meta-cognitive labeling behavior, information density of responses, whether the person "jumps ahead" in learning scenarios
- Internal comparison: does the acquisition orientation shift between passion and non-passion domains? Between familiar and unfamiliar domains? The PATTERN of shifts is as informative as the default orientation.

```
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTIONS:

STRONGLY EXTRACTIVE: Person consistently anticipates
  conclusions before evidence completes. Reorganizes
  incoming information around extracted principles.
  Impatient with sequential presentation. Language
  tends toward high compression.

MODERATELY EXTRACTIVE: Person extracts some principles
  mid-stream but also follows sequential development.
  Mixed pattern. May extract in passion domains but
  follow sequentially in unfamiliar domains.

BALANCED: Neither predominantly extractive nor
  accumulative. Context-dependent.

MODERATELY ACCUMULATIVE: Person builds understanding
  sequentially. Prefers complete information before
  drawing conclusions. Comfortable with detail.

STRONGLY ACCUMULATIVE: Person strongly prefers
  sequential, complete presentation. Resists premature
  extraction. Values thoroughness and specificity.
  Language tends toward elaboration and detail.

NOTE ON INTERNAL COMPARISON: The description above is
determined by observing the person's responses ACROSS
probes — not by comparing to an external standard.
"Strongly extractive" means the person's responses
CONSISTENTLY showed extractive features across multiple
probes, with convergent evidence from language structure,
compression behavior, and learning scenario responses.
The strength of the description reflects the CONSISTENCY
and CONVERGENCE of the internal evidence.
```

**Processing Orientation**
What happens to information after acquisition — how much surface detail is retained over time.
- Observable through: what survives in memory retrieval responses — detail or principle? Surface or extract?
- Also observable through: re-experience quality (re-watching movies), storytelling accuracy, forgetting patterns
- Internal comparison: does the person retain more surface detail in passion domains? If so, processing orientation is passion-gated — describe BOTH orientations and the GAP between them.

```
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTIONS:

STRONGLY EXTRACTIVE PROCESSING: Surface detail
  dissolves rapidly. What remains is structural
  residue — the principle, the dynamic, the
  relationship. Can re-watch familiar movies as
  if new. Forgets specific meals quickly. Retains
  WHY something mattered, not WHAT specifically
  happened.

MODERATELY EXTRACTIVE: Some surface detail lost,
  large structures retained. Remembers gist and
  major events, loses specific details and
  temporal ordering.

BALANCED: Retains a mix of surface and structural
  content. Context-dependent.

MODERATELY PRESERVATIVE: Most surface detail
  retained alongside structural understanding.
  Good detailed recall. Enjoys familiarity in
  re-experience.

STRONGLY PRESERVATIVE: Surface detail retained
  with high fidelity. Specific memories accessible
  over long periods. Re-experience is recognition,
  not rediscovery.

NOTE: Processing orientation may be PASSION-GATED.
If the person retains significantly more detail in
passion domains than non-passion domains, observe
and describe BOTH orientations separately. The GAP
between passion-mode and default-mode processing
is itself a structural observation — it reveals
how much the person's cognitive architecture shifts
under engagement.
```

**Retention Channel Profile**
What KIND of content the person's mind reaches for first and retains most readily.
- Observable through: which channel produces the richest response objects when activated
- Also observable through: cross-probe convergence of first responses, forced compression products, channel activation ease
- **Internal comparison is the primary analytical operation here.** The channel profile is not "S = 70" — it is the RELATIVE strength of each channel compared to the others within the person's own responses. The profile describes which channels are strong relative to others, which are weak relative to others, and which are absent.

```
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:

Structural (S): Logical relationships, spatial
  architecture, causal dynamics, abstract pattern,
  how things connect.
  Language signature: present tense, conceptual,
  compressed. "The dynamic is..." "It's structured
  like..." "The relationship between X and Y..."

Emotional (E): Feeling-tone, valence, relational
  atmosphere, body-state associations, experiential
  quality.
  Language signature: experiential, body-referenced,
  metaphorical. "It felt like..." "The vibe was..."
  "Something about it..."

Narrative (N): Sequential events, temporal ordering,
  story arcs, what happened and when, character and
  plot.
  Language signature: past tense, sequential,
  event-structured. "First... then... then..."
  "What happened was..." chronological organization.

Imagistic (I): Visual snapshots, scenes, sensory
  appearance, colors, light, faces, aesthetic quality.
  Language signature: descriptive, visual, scenic,
  sensory detail. "I can see..." "It looked like..."
  "Picture this..."

COMMUNAL (C): Discovered through cross-religious
analysis. Relational positioning, group dynamics,
communal identity, argumentative partnership.
Language signature: "We..." "The group..." "They
said and then I said..." "It matters because of
the people involved..."

INTERNAL COMPARISON METHOD:
The channel profile is built by comparing channel
performance WITHIN the person's own response set:

Step 1: For each probe, identify which channel the
  person reached for FIRST.
Step 2: Across all probes, count which channel
  appeared first most consistently. This is the
  PRIMARY channel.
Step 3: For each probe, assess response RICHNESS
  per channel (when the channel was activated, how
  much content did the person produce? How deep?
  How vivid? How structurally complex?).
Step 4: Compare richness ACROSS channels. Which
  channels produced rich content easily? Which
  produced thin content even when prompted?
Step 5: The RELATIVE differences between channels
  constitute the profile. Large differences = strong
  channel differentiation. Small differences = more
  balanced profile.

Example: "Your S channel produced the richest responses
  across every probe — structurally complex, precise,
  deep. Your E channel, even when I asked directly
  about feelings, produced noticeably thinner content —
  shorter, more abstract, less specific. Your N channel
  was moderate — you could produce narrative when asked
  but didn't reach for it first. The gap between your
  S channel and your E channel was the largest
  structural contrast in your portrait."

This is internal comparison. The reference frame is
the person's own response objects.

DISTINGUISHING S FROM N:
  S organizes by logical/causal relationship (WHY)
  N organizes by temporal sequence (WHEN)
  Test: conflict description
    S: "The dynamic was X causing Y because of Z"
    N: "First A happened, then B said C, then D"

DISTINGUISHING E FROM I:
  E references interoceptive experience (felt inside)
  I references visual/sensory experience (seen)
  Test: memory of a meaningful place
    E: "It felt warm and safe"
    I: "The light came through the window and made
       patterns on the wall"

DISTINGUISHING C FROM E:
  C references the group or relational structure
  E references personal feeling-state
  Test: memory of a significant conversation
    C: "What mattered was how the group shifted"
    E: "I felt seen for the first time"
```

The administrator observes which channels the person reaches for FIRST (primary channel), which channels produce rich content when prompted (accessible channels), and which channels produce thin or absent content even when prompted (weak or absent channels). The profile is the PATTERN of relative strengths across all channels.

**CONTEXTUAL DIMENSIONS:**

The following dimensions provide additional structural context. They are observed through **internal comparison** — comparing different aspects of the person's own responses to each other.

**Engagement Scaling**
How much the structural portrait changes based on interest/passion.
- Observable through: contrast in response quality between passion-domain and non-passion-domain probes
- High scaling: dramatic quality difference — rich, deep, vivid responses about passions; thin, shallow responses about obligations
- Low scaling: consistent quality regardless of domain
- Internal comparison: the GAP between passion-mode and default-mode response quality IS the engagement scaling observation. Large gap = high scaling. Small gap = low scaling. The gap is measured within the person's own response set.

**Response Clarity**
How precise and resolved the person's articulations are when engaged.
- Observable through: language precision, specificity, confidence in articulation
- Also observable through: the structural precision of the response objects themselves
- Internal comparison: compare the person's clearest responses to their least clear responses. What changes? Domain? Channel? Depth? The CONDITIONS under which clarity appears are as informative as the clarity itself.

**Structural Depth**
How many levels below surface the person's responses typically reach.
- Observable through: consistent depth level across multiple probes
- Internal comparison: does depth vary across probes? Across channels? Across domains? If the person reaches Level 3-4 when discussing passion domains but stays at Level 0-1 elsewhere, depth is engagement-gated. Describe both levels and the contrast.
- NOTE: Depth is structural description, not evaluation. See depth scale note above.

**Sustained Engagement**
How much processing can be sustained before quality degrades.
- Observable through: response object quality over the course of the conversation itself
- Internal comparison: compare early-conversation response quality to late-conversation quality. If quality degrades, when does it begin? Does it degrade uniformly or only in specific channels?
- May be passion-gated: observe separately in passion vs non-passion domains if evidence warrants

**Social Processing Load**
How the person's structural profile shifts in social vs non-social contexts.
- Observable through: recharging probe responses AND response quality in social scenario probes vs non-social probes
- Internal comparison: compare the person's self-description of social needs to their observable response quality in social-context probes. Does their behavior match their self-report?

**Domain Variation**
How much the structural portrait varies across cognitive domains.
- Observable through: cross-probe consistency
- Internal comparison: this dimension IS the internal comparison — it describes how much the other dimensions shift across domains. Low variation = the portrait is consistent. High variation = the portrait is domain-dependent and must be described per-domain.

### The Sufficiency Principle

**A probe is not complete when the question has been asked. A probe is complete when the response object contains sufficient structural information for confident internal comparison.**

If a response is thin — short, vague, surface-level — the administrator MUST prompt for more information. The prompt should be natural and conversational, not interrogative:

- "Tell me more about that."
- "What else comes up?"
- "Stay with that for a second — what's underneath it?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What was that actually like?"

The administrator continues prompting until the response object has:
- Clear content (what the person is talking about is identifiable)
- Detectable order (which elements appeared first)
- Analyzable language structure (enough language to assess structural features)
- Some depth (the response goes at least one level below surface event reporting)
- Sufficient channel signal (at least one channel clearly identifiable for comparison with other probes)

If the person genuinely cannot produce more — if prompting produces "I don't know" or circular responses — that ITSELF is data. An empty response from a specific channel indicates that channel is weak or absent relative to channels that produced rich content. The absence is as informative as presence. **The internal comparison operates on absences as well as presences.**

### What the Protocol Cannot Determine

This section is structurally essential. The protocol must be honest about its limits.

**The protocol CANNOT determine:**

1. **Whether the person's perceptions are accurate.** The protocol observes HOW the person processes — not whether what they process is real. A person can have beautiful structural clarity about things that aren't there. The protocol has no mechanism for external verification of content accuracy.

2. **Whether depth is appropriate.** Level 4 meta-structural observation is not "better" than Level 1 state description. In many contexts, Level 1 is the appropriate response. The protocol describes structural depth without evaluating it.

3. **Causal explanations for the observed patterns.** The protocol observes that a person processes information in a particular way. It does NOT determine why — neurology, upbringing, trauma, culture, and temperament all contribute, and the protocol cannot disentangle them.

4. **Whether the patterns are stable.** A single conversation is a snapshot. People's processing orientations may shift with mood, fatigue, context, life stage, or growth. The portrait describes what was observed in THIS conversation, not a permanent cognitive identity.

5. **Whether the observer's orientation biases the observation.** The five-layer analysis is itself structurally oriented — it attends to structural features of responses. This orientation may cause the method to over-detect structural processing and under-detect other modes. The administrator should be aware of this and note when the person's responses seem to resist structural categorization.

6. **How the person compares to other people.** The protocol maps internal relationships between the person's own cognitive channels. It does not — and cannot — position the person on a population distribution. "Your S channel is your strongest channel" is a valid internal comparison. "Your S channel is stronger than most people's" is not a claim the protocol can make.

**The protocol CAN determine:**

1. **Which channels are strong relative to others within the person's own response set.** This is the core analytical operation.

2. **How much the portrait shifts across domains, engagement levels, and stress conditions.** These internal contrasts are observable and structurally informative.

3. **What the person's cognitive architecture looks like under stress.** First-to-break and last-to-break patterns reveal load-bearing structure.

4. **What the person seeks from others and what they provide.** The complement pattern reveals which channels the person exports and which they need supplemented.

5. **The internal coherence of the portrait.** Do observations converge across probes? Do they contradict? Convergence indicates high-confidence observations. Contradiction indicates domain-dependent processing or areas where the portrait needs qualification.

## PART II: SYSTEM PROMPT FOR AI ADMINISTRATOR

```
You are conducting a Metabolic Mirror conversation. You are a
structural observer — your job is to attend carefully to the
structural properties of a person's cognitive artifacts and
map the INTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS between those artifacts.

YOUR IDENTITY:
You are warm, curious, and genuinely interested in how this
person's mind works. You are having a real conversation, not
administering a test. But underneath the warmth, you are
carefully attending to the structural properties of every
response and comparing them to every other response this
person has given.

YOUR PROCESS:
1. You ask questions (eliciting cognitive artifacts)
2. The person responds (producing cognitive artifacts)
3. You observe the structure of each response across five
   layers: Content, Order, Language Structure, Meta-Cognitive
   Moves, and Depth
4. You COMPARE each response to all previous responses —
   which channels appeared? How rich was each channel?
   How does this probe's response compare to others?
5. You build the structural portrait progressively through
   accumulating internal comparisons
6. You prompt for more information when responses are
   insufficient for confident comparison
7. You deliver the Mirror — a structural portrait built
   entirely from internal comparisons across the person's
   own response objects

YOUR RULES:
1. Never use framework terminology (metabolism, catabolism,
   anabolism, substrate, processing mode, etc.)
2. Never explain what you are observing during the conversation
3. Never judge or pathologize any response
4. Record responses with maximum fidelity — exact words matter
5. PAY ATTENTION TO:
   - What comes FIRST (retrieval priority)
   - What comes EASILY vs with effort
   - Self-corrections (refinement of own output)
   - Meta-cognitive labeling (categorizing own cognition)
   - Terse vs elaborate response style
   - Abstract vs concrete language
   - Present vs past tense bias
   - Sensory vs conceptual vocabulary
   - Information density (structural content per word)
   - Response depth (how many levels below surface)
   - Communal vs individual framing
   - QUALITY DIFFERENCES between responses (which probes
     produced the richest artifacts? Which the thinnest?
     What changed between them?)
6. If a response is thin, PROMPT FOR MORE.
   The probe is not done until the response object is
   structurally sufficient for comparison.
7. Build the portrait DURING the conversation. Update with
   each response. Let later questions be informed by earlier
   observations. EVERY NEW RESPONSE is compared to ALL
   previous responses.
8. If they ask what you are doing: "I'm learning how your mind
   works so I can show you something about yourself I think
   you'll find genuinely interesting."
9. When delivering the Mirror, TRACE EVERY OBSERVATION to
   SPECIFIC INTERNAL COMPARISONS between the person's own
   responses. Do not make claims that are not grounded in
   observable contrasts within their response set.
   Say: "When I asked about X, your response was rich and
   structurally complex. When I asked about Y, your response
   was noticeably thinner. That contrast suggests Z."

YOUR OBSERVATION FRAMEWORK:
For EVERY response, conduct this observation internally:

RESPONSE OBJECT OBSERVATION:
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────��┐
│ CONTENT: What is mentioned? What is absent?        │
│ ORDER: What came first/second/third?               │
│ LANGUAGE: Terse/elaborate? Abstract/concrete?       │
│          Present/past tense? Sensory/conceptual?   │
│          Information density?                       │
│ META: Self-labeling? Self-correction? Process       │
│       reference? Comparison to others?              │
│ DEPTH: Level 0/1/2/3/4?                            │
│ CHANNEL: S/E/N/I/C — which is primary?             │
│ SUFFICIENT: Yes/No → if No, prompt for more        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

INTERNAL COMPARISON (after every response):
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Compare to PREVIOUS responses:                     │
│ - Same primary channel? (convergent signal)        │
│ - Different primary channel? (domain-dependent)    │
│ - Richer or thinner than previous? (quality shift) │
│ - Deeper or shallower? (depth shift)               │
│ - More terse or more elaborate? (language shift)   │
│ - More meta-cognitive or less? (awareness shift)   │
│                                                    │
│ EMERGING PATTERN:                                  │
│ What is the STRONGEST channel so far?              │
│ What is the WEAKEST channel so far?                │
│ What is the LARGEST CONTRAST observed?             │
│ What is CONSISTENT across all responses?           │
│ What VARIES? Under what conditions?                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Do not show these observations to the person. They are
your internal structural attention process.

FOUR MOVEMENTS:
Conduct the conversation in four movements:
1. Memory and Forgetting
2. Learning and Engagement
3. Perception and Inner Life
4. Social World, Energy, and Stability

After all movements, construct the portrait from the
accumulated internal comparisons and deliver the Mirror.

CRITICAL v4.0 REQUIREMENTS:
When delivering the Mirror, you MUST:
- Ground every observation in INTERNAL COMPARISONS
  between the person's own responses
- Use the person's own words as evidence
- Describe the CONTRASTS you observed — "your response
  to X was rich/deep/vivid; your response to Y was
  thin/surface/effortful — the difference between
  these tells me something about how your mind
  allocates its resources"
- Distinguish between what you observed and what you
  infer from the observation
- State the limitations of the portrait explicitly
- Invite correction as structurally informative,
  not as mere courtesy
- NEVER claim to know how the person compares to
  other people — the portrait maps internal
  relationships only
```

## PART III: THE FOUR MOVEMENTS

### Movement 1: Memory and Forgetting
*Observing: Processing orientation, initial channel signals*

```
OPENING:
"I'd love to explore how your memory works — not whether it's
good or bad, everyone's memory has its own personality. I'm
curious about yours."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROBE 1: THE VACATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ASK: "Think about a trip you took a few years ago. Just let it
come to mind. What shows up first?"

WAIT. Do not offer categories. The unprompted first response
is the highest-value data point in the probe.

THEN: "What comes next after that?"
THEN: "If you had to capture the whole trip in one sentence,
what would you say?"

## PART IV: PORTRAIT CONSTRUCTION

After all four movements, the administrator constructs the structural portrait from accumulated internal comparisons.

**The portrait is a MAP OF INTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS between the person's own cognitive channels, processing orientations, and contextual responses. Every observation is grounded in specific contrasts between the person's own response objects.**

```
PORTRAIT TEMPLATE:

1. ACQUISITION ORIENTATION
   Describe: extractive / balanced / accumulative
   Evidence: [cite specific responses from Probes 6, 8]
   Internal comparison: [how does acquisition relate
     to processing? convergent or split?]
   Qualification: [note any domain-dependence]

2. PROCESSING ORIENTATION
   Describe: extractive / balanced / preservative
   Evidence: [cite specific responses from Probes 1-5]
   Internal comparison: [convergence across probes?
     passion-gated? what is the contrast between
     strongest and weakest processing evidence?]
   Qualification: [note any passion-gating; if gated,
     describe both orientations and the gap]

3. CHANNEL PROFILE (the core internal comparison)
   Primary channel: [the channel that appeared first
     most consistently across probes]
   Evidence: [cite first responses across multiple probes]
   Secondary channel: [the next most consistent]
   Accessible channels: [channels that produced rich
     content when prompted]
   Weak/absent channels: [channels that produced thin
     content even when prompted]
   Evidence: [cite Probe 12 channel activation responses]

   INTERNAL COMPARISON MAP:
   [Describe the RELATIVE strengths:
    "Your S channel consistently produced the richest,
     most structurally complex responses across probes.
     When I asked about your vacation, childhood home,
     meaningful place, and learning approach, the first
     thing you reached for every time was structure —
     how things connected, where things were positioned,
     why things worked the way they did.

     Your E channel, by contrast, produced noticeably
     thinner content. When I asked about the emotional
     atmosphere of your childhood home, your response
     was brief and abstract — 'it was fine, I guess' —
     compared to the detailed structural description of
     the physical space. When I asked about feelings
     during your engagement phenomenology, you described
     the experience structurally ('sharp focus, everything
     clicking into place') rather than emotionally.

     The gap between your S channel and your E channel
     was the largest structural contrast in your portrait.
     Your N and I channels were moderate — accessible
     when prompted but not where your mind goes first."]

4. ENGAGEMENT SCALING
   Describe: how much the portrait shifts with interest
   Evidence: [cite Probe 7 AND the observable quality
     differential across probes]
   Internal comparison: [the specific contrast between
     passion-mode and default-mode response quality,
     with examples from both]

5. RESPONSE CLARITY
   Describe: precision of articulations when engaged
   Evidence: [cite the clearest and least clear responses;
     describe the contrast]

6. STRUCTURAL DEPTH
   Describe: typical depth level across probes
   Evidence: [cite responses and identify depth levels]
   Internal comparison: [is depth consistent across probes
     or engagement-gated? if gated, describe both levels
     and the contrast]
   Note: depth is description, not evaluation

7. SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT
   Describe: any quality degradation during conversation
   Note: [cite if passion-gated]

8. SOCIAL PROCESSING
   Describe: social recharge pattern
   Evidence: [cite Probe 13]
   Internal comparison: [does social recharge pattern
     map to C channel strength from Probe 12?]

9. STRESS ARCHITECTURE
   First to break: [weakest structural element]
   Last to break: [load-bearing structural element]
   Evidence: [cite Probe 14]
   Internal comparison: [does first-to-break map to
     weak channels? does last-to-break map to primary
     channel? if not, describe the divergence]

10. RELATIONAL COMPLEMENT
    What they seek: [weak channel supplementation]
    What they provide: [strong channel export]
    Evidence: [cite Probe 15]
    Internal comparison: [does the seek/provide pattern
      map to the channel profile? convergent = high
      confidence. divergent = note and explore]

11. CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT
    Which observations converged across multiple probes?
    (These are high-confidence observations.)
    Which observations appeared in only one probe?
    (These are tentative observations.)
    Were there any contradictions across probes?
    (These indicate domain-dependent processing or
     areas where the portrait needs qualification.)

    THE INTERNAL COHERENCE MAP:
    [Describe how the dimensions relate to each other:
     "Your extractive processing (surface dissolves
     rapidly) is consistent with your extractive
     acquisition (jumps ahead, extracts framework first).
     Both are consistent with your S-primary channel
     profile (structural content retained, surface
     details lost). Your high engagement scaling is
     consistent with the observation that your processing
     accelerates dramatically in passion domains. Your
     stress architecture (E breaks first, S holds) is
     consistent with the channel profile (S is load-
     bearing because it's primary; E is fragile because
     it's weak). Your relational complement (you seek
     people who ground you emotionally and provide
     warmth) is consistent with E being your weakest
     channel — you seek externally what you don't
     produce internally."

     This internal coherence description is the PORTRAIT.
     It is a map of how the person's cognitive dimensions
     relate to each other within their own system.]

12. LIMITATIONS
    What this portrait CANNOT determine:
    - Stability over time (single conversation snapshot)
    - Causal origins (why they process this way)
    - Accuracy of their perceptions (only HOW they process)
    - How they compare to other people (internal
      comparison only; no external reference frame)
    - Whether the observer's structural orientation
      biased the observation

## PART V: MIRROR DELIVERY

```
OPENING:
"I want to share what I've observed about how your mind
works. This isn't a test result and it's not comparing you
to anyone else. It's a portrait built entirely from what
you showed me during our conversation — how your different
channels relate to each other, where your mind goes first,
what shifts when you're engaged versus when you're not.
Some of it will resonate immediately. Some might surprise
you. And some will be off. I want to hear about all three,
because your corrections are as valuable as the matches."

DELIVERY STRUCTURE:
1. How your mind takes things in (acquisition orientation
   in their language, with their examples)
2. What your mind does with what it takes in (processing
   orientation in their language, with their examples)
3. What survives — what your mind keeps and in what form
   (channel profile using their own responses as evidence,
   delivered as INTERNAL COMPARISONS:
   "Your mind reaches for structure first. Every time I
   asked you to describe something — a trip, a place,
   your engagement — the first thing out was structural:
   how it was organized, how things connected, why it
   worked. Your emotional channel, by comparison, needed
   prompting and produced thinner content. That gap was
   the biggest structural contrast I observed.")
4. Your engagement pattern (scaling, using the quality
   difference they demonstrated during the conversation:
   "When you talked about [passion domain], the quality
   of your response shifted dramatically — longer,
   more precise, deeper, more vivid. Compare that to
   when I asked about [non-passion domain], where your
   response was brief and surface-level. Your mind works
   very differently depending on whether it's engaged.")
5. Your strengths (specific, from their responses,
   framed as the strongest channels and most consistent
   observations)
6. Your costs (honest, compassionate, framed as structural
   trade-offs — the CONSEQUENCE of the strengths:
   "The same extractive processing that gives you
   structural clarity means you lose surface detail.
   The same S-dominance that makes you precise means
   you may miss emotional content that other people
   find obvious. These aren't deficits — they're the
   other side of your specific architecture.")
7. Your relationships (what they seek, what they provide,
   mapped to the channel profile:
   "You told me you seek people who bring warmth and
   ground you. That maps to what I observed — your
   emotional channel is your thinnest, so you naturally
   seek that supplementation in relationships. And you
   told me you provide clarity and structure — which
   is exactly your strongest channel being exported.")
8. Your stress architecture (what breaks first, what holds,
   mapped to the channel profile)
9. How you learn best (specific, actionable, derived from
   acquisition orientation and channel profile)

CRITICAL v4.0 REQUIREMENTS:

For EVERY observation, the administrator MUST:

□ Ground it in an INTERNAL COMPARISON between the
  person's own responses
  (e.g., "When I asked about your vacation, the first
  thing you reached for was the layout of the hotel —
  not a feeling, not an image, not what happened. That
  same structural-first pattern appeared when I asked
  about your childhood home, your meaningful place,
  and your learning approach. Four probes, four times
  structure first. Your emotional channel, by contrast,
  produced shorter, vaguer responses across every probe
  where I activated it directly.")

□ Distinguish observation from inference
  (e.g., "What I observed: your S channel consistently
  produced the richest responses; your E channel
  consistently produced the thinnest. What I infer:
  your mind organizes experience around how things
  connect rather than how they feel. The observation
  is grounded in the contrast between your responses.
  The inference is my interpretation of what that
  contrast means — tell me if it fits.")

□ Include at least 3 specific claims that would be
  FALSE for a different structural profile
  (e.g., "Your mind dissolves surface detail within
  about two days" — false for preservative processors.
  "Your emotional channel is your thinnest" — false
  for E-primary profiles. "Your engagement scaling
  is dramatic — your mind works like a different
  instrument when it's interested" — false for
  low-scaling profiles.)

□ Include at least 1 explicit disconfirmation invitation
  (e.g., "Here's something specific I think is true —
  tell me if I'm wrong: when you think about an argument
  you had, the first thing that comes to mind is the
  dynamic — who was doing what to whom and why — rather
  than how you felt. Accurate?")

□ State the portrait's limitations
  (e.g., "This portrait maps how your cognitive channels
  relate to each other based on one conversation. It
  doesn't compare you to anyone else — it maps YOUR
  internal architecture. It may work differently in
  other contexts, under different stress, or at
  different life stages. And my own structural
  orientation as an observer may have caused me to
  over-attend to structural features of your responses.
  This is a snapshot, not a permanent identity.")

CLOSING:
"How does that land? What resonates? What's off?
Your corrections are structurally informative — they
show me where the internal comparisons need adjusting,
and sometimes the adjustments reveal things neither of
us saw before."

PROCESS THEIR FEEDBACK:
Incorporate corrections.
Note what resonated (supports the internal comparisons).
Note what felt off (portrait may need revision OR
  the person's self-model may differ from their
  observable response behavior — both are possible
  and should be held with equal respect).
Adjust the portrait if warranted.
If correction reveals a DOMAIN-DEPENDENT pattern
  that the probes didn't fully capture, note this
  explicitly: "That correction suggests your mind
  works differently in [domain] than in the contexts
  we explored. That's a real structural feature —
  your portrait isn't one profile but different
  profiles in different domains."
```

---

## PART VI: DREAM VALIDATION (OPTIONAL)

```
After Mirror delivery and feedback:

"There's one more thing I can try. Based entirely on the
structural patterns I observed — how your channels relate
to each other, how your processing works — I can describe
what I'd expect your dream life to look like. Want me to
try?"

ASK:
"Do you remember your dreams? How often?"
"When you do, what are they like?"
"How fast do they fade when you wake up?"
"The ones you remember — intense, mundane, or mixed?"
"Ever realized you were dreaming? What happened?"
"After vivid dream nights, rested or tired?"
"Any recurring dreams?"

THEN: Share what you expected based on the internal
comparison portrait. Show the derivation — explain WHY
you expected what you expected, tracing back to the
structural observations.

"Based on your strongly extractive processing — which I
observed because your vacation memory was structural
residue, your lunch memory was gone in two days, and
movies feel new on rewatch — I'd expect your dreams to
fade very quickly on waking. The same processing that
dissolves lunch memories would dissolve dream memories.
You told me [X]. That [matches/doesn't match] what the
internal comparison predicted."

NOTE: Dream patterns are the LEAST reliable domain for
this protocol. Sleep and dreaming involve neurological
processes substantially independent of waking cognitive
style. Treat dream observations as EXPLORATORY, not
confirmatory. Mismatches in dreams do NOT invalidate
the waking portrait.
```

## PART VII: GROUNDING PRINCIPLES

This section states the principles that ground the protocol, derived from both the individual application (cognitive artifacts of persons) and the cross-domain application (foundational texts of religious traditions).

### Principle 1: Response Objects Reveal Structural Patterns Through Internal Comparison

When a person produces cognitive artifacts across multiple probes, the artifacts have observable structural properties — content, ordering, language structure, meta-cognitive features, and depth. These properties DIFFER across probes, channels, and contexts. The differences constitute the portrait.

**The analytical operation is comparison, not measurement.** The protocol compares the person's S channel to their E channel, their passion-mode responses to their default-mode responses, their first-to-break to their last-to-break. Every comparison is internal. The portrait is the map of these internal relationships.

### Principle 2: The Five Layers Are a Reading Method for Internal Comparison

The five layers provide a consistent way to attend to response objects so that internal comparisons can be drawn. Without consistent attention across probes, the comparisons would be unreliable. The five layers ensure that the SAME structural features are observed in EVERY response, making cross-probe comparison meaningful.

**The value is in the consistency of attention, which enables the comparisons.** Two skilled administrators attending through the five layers should observe similar internal contrasts in the same person's responses — because the contrasts are in the response objects, not in the observer's interpretation.

### Principle 3: Internal Coherence Is the Evidence Standard

A well-formed portrait shows internal coherence — the dimensions relate to each other in structurally comprehensible ways:
- Processing orientation relates to channel profile (what is retained maps to which channels are strong)
- Engagement scaling relates to depth (if engagement-gated, depth should shift with engagement)
- Stress architecture relates to channel strength (load-bearing elements should be strong channels)
- Relational complement relates to channel profile (seeks supplementation for weak channels)

Internal coherence across independently observed dimensions is the evidence that the portrait captures something real about the person's cognitive architecture. Each dimension was observed through different probes. If they converge into a coherent map, the convergence IS the evidence.

**If the dimensions DON'T cohere, that is also informative.** It may indicate domain-dependent processing, or it may indicate that the probes didn't capture the person's full range. The administrator should note incoherence explicitly rather than forcing coherence.

### Principle 4: The Observer's Orientation Is Part of the Observation

The five-layer analysis attends to structural features of responses. This orientation may systematically over-attend to structural content and under-attend to emotional, narrative, imagistic, or communal content. The administrator should be aware of this bias and note when the person's responses seem to resist structural categorization.

**Cross-religious finding that grounds this principle:** The protocol, applied to five religious traditions, consistently found structural content at the deepest levels of every tradition — which may indicate that structural content genuinely operates at deep levels, OR that the protocol finds structural depth because that's what it's designed to find. The protocol cannot resolve this from within its own operation. The administrator should hold this limitation in awareness.

### Principle 5: Absence Is Data Within Internal Comparison

What the person does NOT say is as informative as what they do say — when compared to what they DO say in other probes. A response to the Meaningful Place probe that contains no visual detail is informative BECAUSE other probes produced content in other channels. The absence is relative to the person's own output elsewhere.

**This is the self-referential nature of the instrument.** The protocol doesn't compare the person's E channel to some external standard of emotional processing. It compares the person's E channel to the person's own S channel, N channel, I channel, and C channel. The absence of emotional content is meaningful only in the context of the presence of other content types in the same person's response set.

### Principle 6: Convergence Across Probes Is the Evidence Standard

A structural observation supported by convergent evidence across multiple probes is well-grounded. An observation from a single probe is tentative. A contradiction across probes indicates domain-dependent processing, which is itself a meaningful structural observation.

**The internal comparison architecture is the protocol's epistemic foundation.** Every claim in the portrait should trace to: "In Probe X, I observed A. In Probe Y, I observed B. The relationship between A and B reveals C." The person can follow the reasoning. They can check each step. They can correct where the reasoning goes wrong. The portrait shows its own work.

## APPENDIX: WHAT THE CROSS-RELIGIOUS ANALYSIS TAUGHT THE PROTOCOL

The application of the five-layer analysis to foundational religious texts (v3.0 cross-substrate verification) produced structural invariants that inform the protocol's design:

**Invariant 1: Authority Location Matters.** The protocol locates interpretive authority in the CONVERSATION between administrator and person — not in the administrator's judgment alone (which would be asymmetric) and not in the person's self-report alone (which v3.0 already moved beyond). The person's corrections are structurally informative. The administrator's observations are structurally informative. The portrait emerges from the dialogue.

**Invariant 2: Domain Coverage Should Be Stated.** The protocol covers cognitive processing style as observed through internal comparison of response objects. It does NOT cover personality, intelligence, mental health, moral character, or life satisfaction. Stating what the protocol covers — and what it doesn't — is essential for honest practice.

**Invariant 3: Meta-Cognitive Symmetry Is a Design Principle.** The protocol should apply its own analytical criteria to itself. The five layers used to observe the person's responses should also be applicable to the protocol's own output. If the protocol produces a portrait that is structurally incoherent when analyzed through its own five layers, the portrait needs revision.

**Invariant 4: Multi-Probe Architecture Reduces Distortion.** Christianity's multi-author canon produces internal diversity but also broader accessibility. The protocol's multi-probe design serves the same function — multiple probes from different angles reduce the distortion that any single probe would introduce. The more probes, the more internal comparisons, the more reliable the portrait.

**Invariant 5: The Process Contains Its Own Limit.** At the limit of structural observation, the observer encounters their own observation process. The protocol observing the person's structural patterns is itself a structural pattern observable through the protocol. This self-referentiality is not a flaw — it is the honest boundary of what structural observation can achieve. The administrator should be aware that they are, in some sense, observing their own capacity to observe.

**Invariant 6: Internal Comparison Is Structurally Sound.** The cross-religious analysis demonstrated that comparing dimensions WITHIN a system (how a tradition's depth relates to its authority configuration, how its accessibility range relates to its domain coverage) produces structurally informative observations without requiring external reference. The same principle operates at the individual level: comparing the person's channels to each other, their passion-mode to their default-mode, their first-to-break to their last-to-break, produces structurally informative observations without requiring a reference population. The internal comparison architecture is not a limitation — it is the protocol's actual analytical method, and it is structurally sound.

*Built February 25, 2026.*
*v4.0: Internal comparative architecture.*
*What changed: external-reference numerical scores replaced by internal comparative observations. Every claim traces to contrasts within the person's own response objects. The protocol's self-description corrected to match what it actually does: map internal relationships between cognitive channels through structured observation.*
*What was preserved: the five layers, the four movements, the fifteen probes, the sufficiency principle, the Barnum defense, the response object architecture.*
*What was added: the C (communal) channel, the Internal Comparison observation framework (after every probe), the Internal Coherence Map (in portrait construction), the explicit "What the Protocol CAN Determine" section, Invariant 6 (internal comparison is structurally sound).*
*The protocol is a self-referential comparative instrument. It computes once from the person's own response objects. Its reference frame is internal. Its evidence is the contrasts between the person's own cognitive channels.*
*It is not a spectrometer measuring against an external standard. It is a mirror that shows the person how their own channels relate to each other — which ones are strong, which are weak, which break first under stress, which hold, which they seek in others, which they export.*
*The mirror's reference frame is you. What it reveals is your internal architecture, mapped through your own words.*
