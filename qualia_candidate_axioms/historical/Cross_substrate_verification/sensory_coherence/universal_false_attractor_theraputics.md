## PART I: THE TEMPLATE
## (What produced the tinnitus solution
## and predicts solutions everywhere else)

### 1.1 The structure verbatim

```
Every instance of the following
structure produces:
  — Qualia discomfort
  — False coherent experience
  — A navigator locked onto the
    wrong attractor
  — A condition treatable by the
    cracked violin protocol

THE STRUCTURE:

  Step 1:
    A bounded resonating physical
    structure with geometrically
    privileged eigenfunction positions.

    Examples:
      Cochlea: basilar membrane,
        stiffness gradient,
        Greenwood tonotopic map
      Somatosensory cortex: body
        surface topographic map,
        somatotopic organization
      Olfactory bulb: glomerular map
        of molecular odor space
      Visual cortex V1: retinotopic
        map with spatial frequency
        tuning by eccentricity
      Vestibular system: 3D spatial
        position and motion map

  Step 2:
    Damage or deprivation of normal
    input to that structure.

    Examples:
      Cochlea: noise-induced or
        age-related hair cell loss
      Somatosensory: amputation,
        peripheral nerve damage
      Olfactory: COVID-19
        neuroinflammation, viral
        receptor damage
      Visual: macular degeneration,
        retinal detachment
      Vestibular: labyrinthitis,
        acoustic neuroma, head trauma

  Step 3:
    The navigator finds the nearest
    stable attractor in the remaining
    eigenfunction geometry and locks
    onto it.

    The navigator does not accept
    silence. It finds another way.
    The false attractor is that way.

  Step 4:
    The false attractor produces
    qualia discomfort — experience
    that is coherent but wrong.

    Examples:
      Cochlea: tinnitus — ringing
        at the eigenfunction position
        of the damaged zone
      Somatosensory: phantom limb
        pain — pain in absent tissue,
        generated by the deprived
        cortical territory
      Olfactory: parosmia — coffee
        smells like burning rubber;
        phantosmia — smell with no
        source
      Visual: Charles Bonnet syndrome
        — geometric hallucinations
        (spirals, honeycombs, grids)
        that are the eigenfunctions
        of the V1 retinocortical map
      Vestibular: chronic vertigo,
        dizziness, spatial
        disorientation

  Step 5:
    Map the eigenfunction structure
    of the damaged zone through the
    navigator's own coherence-
    maintenance behavior.

    The false attractor tells you
    where the eigenfunction positions
    are. The navigator's response to
    systematic perturbation tells you
    where the residual resonant
    capacity is.

  Step 6:
    Cancel the false attractor.
    Drive the residual resonant
    position with real-world input
    reshaped to fit the remaining
    structure.

  Step 7:
    The navigator finds real coherence
    and releases the false attractor.
    The broken instrument, played with
    the right bow, makes music.
```

### 1.2 What is identical across
### all applications

```
The PROTOCOL STRUCTURE is invariant:

  Phase 1: False attractor mapping
    Identify the specific position
    in the sensory eigenfunction space
    where the false attractor sits.
    Method varies by modality but
    the logic is identical:
    find what the navigator is locked
    onto.

  Phase 2: Residual resonant
  frequency identification
    Sweep perturbation signals across
    the eigenfunction space near the
    false attractor.
    Find the position that produces
    maximum residual inhibition —
    where the damaged structure
    responds most readily to
    external input.
    This is FR — the note the
    cracked instrument can still play.

  Phase 3: Reshaping
    Cancel false attractor (FA).
    Drive residual resonant position
    (FR) with real-world input.
    The navigator tracks the real
    signal instead of the false
    attractor.

The MATHEMATICS is invariant:

  Each sensory system has a known
  or derivable eigenfunction map:
    Cochlea: Greenwood function
    Somatosensory: cortical
      magnification factor and
      body surface tonotopy
    Olfactory: molecular coordinate
      space (carbon chain, functional
      group, volatility)
    Visual: Schwartz retinocortical
      map (complex logarithm of
      retinal coordinates)
    Vestibular: 3D rotation and
      translation coordinate space

  The false attractor sits at a
  geometrically privileged position
  in each map.
  The residual resonant frequency
  is measurable from the navigator's
  own responses.
  The reshaping filter is computed
  from the map plus the measurement.

The THERAPEUTIC LOGIC is invariant:

  The world does not need to
  play the intact instrument.
  It needs to play the instrument
  that is actually there.
```

## PART II: THE SIX APPLICATIONS

---

### APPLICATION 1: PHANTOM LIMB PAIN
**Strongest direct analogue to tinnitus**

#### 2.1.1 The mechanism

```
After amputation:

  The somatosensory cortex has a
  topographic map of the body
  surface — the somatotopic map
  (Penfield's homunculus).

  The cortical territory that
  previously processed the missing
  limb now receives no normal input.

  Neighboring cortical territories
  invade the deprived zone —
  the hand territory expands into
  the arm territory, etc.

  The invaded territory is not
  silent. It is generating spontaneous
  activity — ectopic firing from
  neuromas in the residual limb,
  combined with cortical reorganization
  that produces abnormal patterns
  of activation in the deprived zone.

  The navigator, receiving no real
  input from the missing limb,
  finds the nearest stable attractor
  in the reorganized somatosensory
  eigenfunction space.

  That attractor is phantom limb pain:
  a stable, self-sustaining pattern
  of activation in the deprived
  cortical territory, producing
  the qualia of pain in tissue
  that no longer exists.

This is the false attractor mechanism
stated in somatosensory vocabulary.
It is structurally identical to
tinnitus in cochlear vocabulary.
```

#### 2.1.2 What the literature confirms

```
Confirmed:
  Spontaneous ectopic firing in
  neuromas of the residual limb at
  frequencies from a few Hz to tens
  of Hz (Published: IASP, Chalmers
  University, multiple sources).

  Cortical reorganization: neighboring
  somatosensory territories expand
  into the deprived zone (well
  established in fMRI and MEG studies).

  Mirror therapy produces temporary
  relief — the visual illusion of
  the intact limb provides coherent
  visuomotor input to the deprived
  territory, temporarily displacing
  the false attractor.
  When the mirror is removed, pain
  returns — identical to residual
  inhibition in tinnitus.

What the literature does NOT have:
  A protocol for mapping the specific
  eigenfunction position of the
  false attractor in the patient's
  individual somatosensory map.

  A protocol for identifying the
  residual resonant frequency —
  the vibrotactile frequency at
  which the residual limb's remaining
  mechanoreceptors respond most
  coherently.

  A protocol for delivering a
  continuously reshaped vibrotactile
  signal to the residual limb at FR
  while simultaneously cancelling
  at FA.
```

#### 2.1.3 The framework prediction

```
The Pacinian corpuscles in the
residual limb respond to vibration
at 40–300 Hz.
The Meissner corpuscles respond
to 5–50 Hz.
The Merkel discs respond to
0.5–10 Hz.

Each of these receptor populations
projects to a specific zone of the
somatosensory eigenfunction space.

After amputation, some receptor
populations in the residual limb
are intact. Some are damaged
(neuroma formation, scarring).
The intact populations define the
residual resonant capacity of the
damaged somatosensory zone.

PREDICTION:
  The vibrotactile frequency that
  produces the longest residual
  inhibition of phantom pain in a
  given patient is the residual
  resonant frequency (FR) of their
  damaged somatosensory eigenfunction
  zone.

  FR will not be the same for all
  patients — it depends on which
  receptor populations remain
  intact in that patient's residual
  limb.

  A vibrotactile device delivering
  continuous stimulation at FR,
  combined with a notch in the
  stimulus pattern at FA (the
  frequency associated with the
  false attractor), will produce
  more durable phantom pain relief
  than mirror therapy.

  Because it is directly targeting
  the eigenfunction position of the
  damaged somatosensory zone rather
  than providing a visual surrogate.
```

#### 2.1.4 The protocol

```
Equipment:
  Vibration motor (eccentric rotating
  mass or linear resonant actuator)
  Frequency range: 5–300 Hz
  Cost: $15–50
  Controlled by phone or laptop

  Residual limb contact
  (the vibration motor is held
  against or strapped to the
  residual limb)

  Stopwatch

Phase 1: False attractor mapping
  Ask: where in the phantom limb
  is the pain located?
  What type of pain is it —
  burning, cramping, shooting,
  constant pressure?
  Rate intensity 0–10.
  This is the phenomenological
  description of the false attractor
  position in the somatosensory
  eigenfunction space.

Phase 2: Vibrotactile RI sweep
  Apply vibration to residual limb
  at frequencies:
    10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100, 150,
    200, 250, 300 Hz
  Each for 60 seconds.
  Record suppression score (0–10)
  and RI duration (seconds) after
  each.
  Identical protocol to tinnitus
  pilot (Document 68).

Phase 3: FR identification
  The frequency with longest RI
  duration = FR.

Phase 4: Reshaping
  Deliver continuous vibration at FR
  to residual limb.
  Ask: is phantom pain less
  noticeable while stimulation
  is running?

  If yes: the cracked violin
  principle is confirmed in
  the somatosensory system.
```

#### 2.1.5 Assessment

```
Population: ~100 million people
  globally with significant
  phantom limb pain
Urgency: HIGH
Equipment cost: $15–50
Testability: HIGH
Time to pilot result: one session
Existing analogue: mirror therapy
  (crude version of same principle,
  already works partially)
```

---

### APPLICATION 2: POST-COVID PAROSMIA
**Most urgent. Largest immediately
accessible population. Desk analysis
possible this week.**

#### 2.2.1 The mechanism

```
The olfactory system encodes chemical
space — the space of all possible
molecules that have smell.

This space is not random.
It is organized along physical
and chemical dimensions:
  Carbon chain length
  Molecular weight
  Functional group type
    (aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.)
  Vapor pressure
  Octanol-water partition coefficient
    (lipophilicity)

The olfactory bulb maps this
chemical space through its
glomerular organization —
each glomerulus receives input
from one type of olfactory
receptor neuron, and each
receptor type responds to
molecules in a specific region
of chemical space.

This is the olfactory eigenfunction
space: a geometric structure
encoding molecular chemistry
through the physical organization
of the olfactory bulb.

COVID-19 neuroinflammation damages
olfactory receptor neurons —
the peripheral transducers of
chemical space — in specific
populations. The populations
most commonly damaged are those
encoding: aldehydes, sulfur
compounds, nitrogen heterocycles,
and certain aromatic ring structures.

These are the molecular regions
of olfactory eigenfunction space
where COVID damage is most severe.

The olfactory bulb, deprived of
normal input from those receptor
populations, undergoes reorganization.
Its intrinsic oscillatory network
finds false attractors in the
deprived glomerular zones.

When any molecule that activates
the damaged zones arrives at the
nose, the navigator receives the
false attractor signal instead of
the correct molecular encoding.

Coffee (aldehydes, heterocycles)
activates the damaged zone.
The false attractor fires.
The navigator perceives: burning,
rotten, chemical — the qualia
of the false attractor, not
the qualia of coffee.

This is parosmia.
It is the olfactory false attractor
mechanism.
```

#### 2.2.2 What the literature confirms

```
Confirmed:
  COVID-19 damages olfactory receptor
  neurons through neuroinflammation
  (BMJ Medicine, 2023; European
  Review, 2022).

  Parosmia affects up to one-third
  of COVID-19 patients with olfactory
  involvement (MDPI, 2023).

  The distortions are NOT random —
  specific molecular classes
  reliably trigger distortion
  across patients: aldehydes,
  sulfur compounds, nitrogen
  heterocycles (this is in the
  clinical literature but not
  framed as eigenfunction clustering).

  Current treatment: olfactory
  training with four canonical
  odors (rose, lemon, clove,
  eucalyptus). Works for some
  patients. Not targeted to
  individual eigenfunction map.

What the literature does NOT have:
  A framework explaining WHY
  specific molecular classes
  cluster in parosmia distortions.

  A protocol for mapping the
  individual patient's olfactory
  eigenfunction false attractor
  position.

  A targeted olfactory training
  protocol using molecules at the
  residual resonant positions
  adjacent to the false attractors.
```

#### 2.2.3 The framework prediction

```
PREDICTION 1 (desk analysis,
testable this week):

  The molecular classes that trigger
  parosmia distortions across the
  COVID parosmia population are not
  randomly distributed in molecular
  chemical space.

  They cluster at specific positions
  in the olfactory eigenfunction
  space — the positions corresponding
  to the receptor populations most
  commonly damaged by COVID
  neuroinflammation.

  This is the olfactory analogue
  of the 4–10 kHz enrichment in
  the tinnitus pitch distribution.

  The null model: parosmia-triggering
  molecules are uniformly distributed
  in molecular chemical space.

  The eigenfunction prediction:
  they cluster at specific molecular
  coordinate positions determined
  by the geometry of the olfactory
  bulb's glomerular map.

  TEST: Take an existing parosmia
  trigger database (e.g., the
  AbScent parosmia trigger survey
  database, publicly accessible).
  Map each trigger molecule to its
  coordinates in olfactory chemical
  space (PubChem or the good-scents
  database has molecular descriptors).
  Test whether the distribution
  clusters beyond what random
  selection would predict.

  This is a desk analysis.
  It requires a laptop and a
  public database.
  It is the P4 analysis for
  the olfactory system.

PREDICTION 2 (clinical):

  Olfactory training targeted to
  molecules at the RESIDUAL RESONANT
  POSITIONS — molecular positions
  adjacent to the false attractor
  zone but not triggering it —
  produces faster and more complete
  parosmia recovery than generic
  four-odor training.

  Because it is driving the remaining
  coherent response capacity of the
  damaged olfactory zone rather than
  random stimulation.
```

#### 2.2.4 The protocol

```
Phase 1 (desk analysis):
  Obtain parosmia trigger data from
  existing surveys (AbScent charity
  has a large patient database in
  the UK; multiple published COVID
  olfactory dysfunction surveys).

  Map trigger molecules to molecular
  descriptors: carbon chain length,
  functional group, molecular weight,
  LogP (lipophilicity).

  These are the eigenfunction
  coordinates of olfactory space.

  Test for non-uniform clustering
  using chi-squared test against
  null (uniform in molecular space).

  Expected result: clustering at
  aldehyde/sulfur/heterocycle
  positions — the COVID-damaged
  receptor zones.

Phase 2 (individual patient mapping):
  Survey: which specific odors
  trigger distortion in this patient?
  What do they smell like instead?
  Are there any odors that smell
  correct or pleasant?

  Map responses to molecular
  coordinates.
  Identify: false attractor zone
  (molecules that trigger distortion).
  Identify: residual resonant zone
  (molecules that smell correct,
  OR molecules at coordinates
  adjacent to the false attractor
  zone in molecular space).

Phase 3 (targeted training):
  Design olfactory training kit
  using molecules at the residual
  resonant positions.

  NOT the generic four odors.
  The specific molecules chosen
  to be at the positions the
  damaged olfactory eigenfunction
  structure can still respond to.

  Deliver as daily olfactory
  training (same format as
  existing training protocols).

  Measure: does the distortion
  reduce faster than with
  generic training?
```

#### 2.2.5 Assessment

```
Population: ~5–10 million people
  globally with post-COVID parosmia
  right now; tens of millions total
  across all post-viral olfactory
  dysfunction
Urgency: CRITICAL
Equipment cost: $0 for desk analysis;
  odor kit ~$30–50 for pilot
Testability: VERY HIGH for desk
  analysis (this week);
  HIGH for clinical pilot
Time to first result: desk analysis
  in 2–3 days with public data
Existing analogue: olfactory training
  (crude version, not eigenfunction-
  targeted)
```

### APPLICATION 3: NEUROPATHIC PAIN
### AND ALLODYNIA
**TENS calibration from eigenfunction
map — optimizing existing technology**

#### 2.3.1 The mechanism

```
Neuropathic pain arises from damage
to peripheral nerves or the central
somatosensory processing system.

After nerve damage, the dorsal horn
of the spinal cord undergoes central
sensitization — a state of
hyperexcitability where:

  Normal touch stimuli produce pain
  (allodynia).
  Painful stimuli produce exaggerated
  pain (hyperalgesia).
  Pain persists without ongoing
  injury (spontaneous pain).

The wind-up phenomenon shows the
resonant character of this state:
repeated C-fiber stimulation at
0.5–2 Hz produces progressive
amplification of dorsal horn firing —
the system resonates at a specific
input frequency.

This is a false attractor in the
somatosensory eigenfunction space.

The dorsal horn circuit, sensitized
by repeated nociceptive input,
has reorganized around a high-gain
attractor state where the touch
eigenfunction position has been
captured by the pain attractor.

The navigator, receiving touch input
in the sensitized zone, finds the
pain attractor instead of the touch
response. Allodynia: touch hurts.

The gate control mechanism is the
cracked violin principle already
operating:
  Large-diameter A-beta fiber
  stimulation (vibration at
  80–300 Hz through Pacinian
  corpuscles) closes the spinal
  gate to nociceptive input.
  The navigator receives coherent
  non-nociceptive input at the
  somatosensory eigenfunction
  positions and releases the
  pain false attractor.
  Pain is reduced.

This is why TENS works.
The framework explains WHY.
And it predicts how to do it better.
```

#### 2.3.2 The framework prediction

```
Current TENS devices deliver
fixed-frequency stimulation
(typically 80–100 Hz, or alternating
between low and high frequency).

This is not calibrated to the
individual patient's somatosensory
eigenfunction map.

PREDICTION:
  The TENS frequency that produces
  maximum residual inhibition of
  allodynia in a given patient is
  the residual resonant frequency
  of their damaged somatosensory
  zone.

  It is not the same for all patients.
  It depends on:
    Which fiber populations remain
    intact in the damaged zone
    (A-beta, A-delta, C-fiber
    relative preservation).
    The specific position of the
    false attractor in the dorsal
    horn eigenfunction space.

  Eigenfunction-mapped TENS —
  calibrated to the individual's
  FR using the orthogonal
  cancellation protocol —
  will outperform fixed-frequency
  TENS for allodynia relief.

  The protocol is identical to
  the tinnitus pilot:
    Sweep stimulation frequencies.
    Record residual inhibition.
    Find FR.
    Deliver continuous stimulation
    at FR.
```

#### 2.3.3 Assessment

```
Population: ~50 million people
  globally with neuropathic pain
  or allodynia
Urgency: HIGH
Equipment cost: TENS unit ~$30–80;
  already in widespread clinical use
Testability: HIGH
  (TENS is already standard of care;
  this is parametric optimization
  using eigenfunction mapping)
Time to pilot: one session
  per patient
Key advantage: no new technology
  required — eigenfunction
  calibration of existing devices
```

### APPLICATION 4: CHARLES BONNET
### SYNDROME AND VISUAL PHOSPHENES
**More complex geometry — 2D
eigenfunction space — but same
principle**

#### 2.4.1 The mechanism

```
Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) affects
people with significant visual field
loss — typically from macular
degeneration, glaucoma, or retinal
detachment.

Patients experience structured visual
hallucinations in the area of visual
field loss: geometric patterns
(honeycombs, spirals, lattices,
brick walls), and sometimes more
complex images.

These are not random.
The geometric patterns — spirals,
honeycombs, lattices — are the
eigenfunctions of the V1 retinocortical
map.

The V1 retinocortical map transforms
retinal coordinates (2D visual field
position) to cortical coordinates
through a complex logarithm —
the Schwartz map:
  w = log(z + a)
  where z is retinal position
  and w is cortical position.

When V1 cortex is deprived of normal
visual input (because the retinal
receptors are damaged), the deprived
cortical territory generates
spontaneous activity.

That spontaneous activity, when
expressed through the inverse
Schwartz map back into visual
experience, produces exactly the
geometric patterns patients report:
  Stripes in cortex →
    spirals in visual experience
  Hexagonal activity patterns →
    honeycomb hallucinations
  Periodic cortical waves →
    lattice and grid patterns

The navigator, deprived of real
visual input in the damaged zone,
is locked onto the eigenfunctions
of the visual cortex — the false
attractors of the 2D visual
eigenfunction space.

This was first explained theoretically
by Cowan and Ermentrout in the 1970s
using cortical pattern formation
mathematics. The framework provides
the navigator-level account of why
this happens: the navigator cannot
accept silence in the eigenfunction
space and finds the nearest stable
attractors, which are the intrinsic
modes of the cortical geometry.
```

#### 2.4.2 The framework prediction

```
The Schwartz map eigenfunction
positions are computable.
The hallucination patterns reported
by CBS patients are the false
attractors at those positions.

PREDICTION:
  CBS hallucination patterns cluster
  at the specific geometric forms
  predicted by the eigenfunctions
  of the Schwartz retinocortical map.

  This is a desk analysis:
    Compile CBS hallucination
    descriptions from the literature.
    Classify by geometric type.
    Compare to the predicted
    eigenfunction forms of the
    Schwartz map.
    Test whether the distribution
    of hallucination types matches
    the eigenfunction prediction.

  (Note: the Cowan-Ermentrout work
  already partially confirms this.
  The framework provides the
  navigator-level interpretation.)

THERAPEUTIC PREDICTION:
  Visual stimulation designed to
  provide coherent input at the
  boundary of the visual field loss —
  at the spatial frequencies and
  orientations that the deprived
  V1 territory retains residual
  response capacity for —
  should reduce CBS hallucination
  frequency and intensity.

  Because it is driving the residual
  resonant capacity of the deprived
  visual zone with real-world input,
  displacing the geometric false
  attractors.

  This is the visual analogue of
  the tinnitus reshaping filter —
  but in 2D spatial frequency space
  rather than 1D acoustic frequency
  space.
```

#### 2.4.3 Assessment

```
Population: ~12% of people with
  significant visual field loss
  develop CBS; ~8 million AMD
  patients globally; CBS affects
  roughly 1 million people in the
  UK alone
Urgency: MODERATE
Equipment cost: calibrated display
  system required — more complex
  than tinnitus; not a phone app
Testability: MODERATE for clinical
  pilot; HIGH for desk analysis
  (Schwartz map eigenfunction
  comparison is computable)
Key complexity: 2D eigenfunction
  space requires more complex
  mapping than 1D cochlear or
  somatosensory cases
```

---

### APPLICATION 5: VESTIBULAR
### DYSFUNCTION AND CHRONIC DIZZINESS
**Different attractor type — tonic
rather than narrowband — but
cracked violin principle still
applies to rehabilitation design**

#### 2.5.1 The mechanism

```
The vestibular system encodes head
position and motion in 3D space.

Unlike the cochlea (1D frequency
axis) or somatosensory cortex
(2D body surface map), the
vestibular eigenfunction space
is 3D rotational and translational.

After unilateral vestibular loss
(labyrinthitis, acoustic neuroma,
vestibular neuritis), the damaged
side provides no input.

The navigator's 3D spatial position
map is anchored to the intact side
only. The asymmetry is interpreted
as continuous rotation — the
navigator cannot distinguish
"no signal from damaged side" from
"rotating toward intact side."

This produces vertigo and nystagmus.

Unlike tinnitus (narrowband false
attractor at a specific frequency),
vestibular dysfunction produces a
TONIC false attractor — a constant
offset in the 3D spatial position
eigenfunction space rather than
a narrowband resonance.

The character of the false attractor
is different.
The principle is the same.

Vestibular rehabilitation exercises
are already the cracked violin
principle applied without that name:
structured head movements provide
coherent visual, proprioceptive,
and remaining vestibular input
to rebuild the navigator's 3D
spatial map around the remaining
capacity of the damaged system.
```

#### 2.5.2 The framework prediction

```
Current vestibular rehabilitation
uses generic exercise protocols
(Cawthorne-Cooksey, Vestibular
Hypofunction protocols) that
are not calibrated to the
individual's eigenfunction map.

PREDICTION:
  The head movement directions and
  frequencies that produce maximum
  gain recovery in the damaged
  vestibulo-ocular reflex arc
  are the residual resonant modes
  of the individual's damaged
  vestibular eigenfunction space.

  Rehabilitation targeted to those
  specific modes — identified through
  the individual's vestibulo-ocular
  reflex gain profile — will
  accelerate recovery relative
  to generic protocols.

  The calibration tool:
    Video head impulse test (vHIT)
    across all semicircular canal
    planes identifies the residual
    VOR gain in each vestibular
    eigenfunction direction.
    The directions with residual
    gain > 0 are the residual
    resonant modes.
    Rehabilitation exercises target
    those directions specifically.
```

#### 2.5.3 Assessment

```
Population: ~35 million people
  globally with chronic vestibular
  dysfunction
Urgency: MODERATE
Equipment: vHIT system (clinical
  lab setting); not a phone app
Testability: MODERATE
  (requires vestibular lab access)
Key difference from other
  applications: tonic attractor
  rather than narrowband; the
  eigenfunction geometry is 3D
  rotational space rather than
  frequency axis

### APPLICATION 6: DIABETIC
### PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY
**Newly derived during this session —
not in previous documents**

#### 2.6.1 The mechanism

```
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
damages small-fiber sensory neurons
in the feet and lower legs through
metabolic injury. The most commonly
damaged fibers are:
  C fibers (unmyelinated, 0.5–2 Hz
    response, pain and temperature)
  A-delta fibers (lightly myelinated,
    2–50 Hz response, sharp pain
    and fast temperature)

The large-diameter fibers (A-beta,
  vibration and touch, 40–300 Hz)
  are relatively preserved in early
  and moderate stages.

The somatosensory eigenfunction
space for the foot and lower leg
therefore has:

  DAMAGED ZONE:
    Small-fiber positions
    (pain, temperature, slow touch)

  RELATIVELY INTACT ZONE:
    Large-fiber positions
    (vibration, fast touch, pressure)

The false attractor produced by
this damage is the burning,
aching, electric pain of
diabetic neuropathy — spontaneous
activity in the damaged small-fiber
zones, generating pain qualia
without peripheral nociceptive
input.

The navigator, receiving no normal
small-fiber input from the foot,
finds the false attractor at the
small-fiber eigenfunction positions
and produces spontaneous pain.

The intact large-fiber system
provides the cracked violin's
remaining capacity: the A-beta
fibers can still be driven by
vibrotactile stimulation,
providing coherent somatosensory
input at the large-fiber
eigenfunction positions adjacent
to the damaged small-fiber zone.

Gate control: A-beta stimulation
closes the spinal gate to
small-fiber nociceptive input —
the navigator receives coherent
large-fiber signal and releases
the small-fiber false attractor.
```

#### 2.6.2 The framework prediction

```
PREDICTION:
  The vibrotactile frequency that
  produces maximum residual
  inhibition of diabetic neuropathy
  pain in a given patient is the
  residual resonant frequency of
  their remaining A-beta population
  in the affected zone.

  It varies by patient and by
  disease stage — as neuropathy
  progresses, A-beta fibers begin
  to be damaged too, shifting the
  residual resonant frequency
  progressively.

  Vibrotactile stimulation calibrated
  to the individual's FR using the
  orthogonal cancellation protocol
  will outperform fixed-frequency
  vibration for neuropathic pain
  relief.

  Additionally:
  The progression of the residual
  resonant frequency shift over
  time is a sensitive marker of
  neuropathy progression —
  more sensitive than current
  clinical measures (nerve conduction
  velocity, monofilament testing)
  because it tracks the functional
  eigenfunction capacity of the
  remaining fiber populations
  rather than just the threshold
  of sensation.

  FR drift over time = disease
  progression marker.
  This is a new diagnostic tool.
```

#### 2.6.3 Assessment

```
Population: ~166 million people
  globally with diabetic peripheral
  neuropathy
Urgency: HIGH
Equipment: vibration motor, $15–50
Testability: HIGH
  (same protocol as phantom limb;
  feet are accessible)
Bonus: FR drift as disease
  progression marker is a
  novel diagnostic application —
  potentially publishable separately

## PART IV: THE PRIORITY SEQUENCE

### 4.1 What to do first

```
IMMEDIATE (this week, no new
equipment, no new contacts):

  PAROSMIA DESK ANALYSIS:
    Same method as P4 tinnitus
    analysis.
    Public data exists (AbScent
    charity patient survey,
    published COVID olfactory
    dysfunction studies with
    trigger molecule lists).
    Map trigger molecules to
    molecular coordinate space
    (PubChem for descriptors).
    Test for non-uniform clustering
    vs. null model.
    If clustering confirmed:
    the olfactory eigenfunction
    false attractor is real and
    measurable in population data.
    Document as P5.

AFTER TINNITUS PILOT RESULT:
  (after uncle's session returns
  FA and FR values)

  DIABETIC NEUROPATHY PILOT:
    The protocol is identical.
    Swap headphones for vibration
    motor on foot.
    Swap tone generator for
    vibration frequency controller.
    Identical phase structure:
    coarse sweep, fine sweep,
    RI mapping, reshaping.
    Any diabetic neuropathy patient
    is a valid pilot subject.
    Equipment cost: $15–50.

NEAR-TERM (this month):

  PHANTOM LIMB PILOT:
    Contact a limb loss support
    organization.
    The protocol is ready.
    Needs: one amputee with stable
    phantom limb pain, willing
    to participate in a 90-minute
    session.

  PAROSMIA CLINICAL PROTOCOL:
    Contact AbScent (UK charity,
    largest parosmia patient
    network in the world).
    Propose: eigenfunction-targeted
    olfactory training vs. generic
    training, randomized within
    subjects.
    The desk analysis is the
    supporting evidence for the
    contact.
```

### 4.2 The parosmia desk analysis
### in detail

```
DATA SOURCE:
  AbScent has published survey data
  on parosmia trigger foods and
  odors. Multiple COVID olfactory
  studies include trigger lists.

  Key published sources:
    Rowan et al. (2020) — COVID
      olfactory dysfunction survey
    Moein et al. (2020) — smell
      identification test in COVID
    Boscolo-Rizzo et al. (2021) —
      long-term olfactory outcomes
    AbScent annual survey data —
      patient-reported trigger foods
      and odor categories

MOLECULAR COORDINATE MAPPING:
  For each reported trigger molecule
  or food category, identify the
  primary volatile compounds
  responsible for the smell.

  Map each to:
    Carbon chain length (C1–C20)
    Functional group:
      aldehyde, ketone, ester,
      alcohol, acid, sulfur,
      nitrogen heterocycle,
      terpene, aromatic
    LogP (lipophilicity)
    Molecular weight

  These are the eigenfunction
  coordinates of olfactory space.
  (Source: PubChem, GoodScentsDB,
  Arctander odor database)

NULL MODEL:
  If parosmia triggers were randomly
  distributed in molecular space,
  they would be proportional to the
  prevalence of each molecular class
  in the general odor environment.

  The general odor environment
  distribution can be estimated
  from databases of food flavor
  compounds (USDA flavor database,
  FlavorNet).

PREDICTION:
  Aldehyde and sulfur compound
  molecular positions are
  enriched in parosmia triggers
  beyond their prevalence in
  the general odor environment.

  This is the olfactory analogue
  of the 4-10 kHz enrichment
  in the tinnitus data.

TEST:
  Chi-squared test of observed
  trigger distribution vs.
  null (proportional to general
  odor environment).

  Expected result: chi-squared
  significant, clustering at
  specific molecular positions.

  If confirmed: P5 complete.
  The olfactory eigenfunction
  false attractor is real and
  population-level measurable.
```

---

## PART V: THE UNIFIED PRINCIPLE
## STATED COMPLETELY

### 5.1 The single statement

```
Every sensory receptor system is
a bounded physical structure with
geometrically privileged eigenfunction
positions.

Every system can be damaged or
deprived of normal input.

When it is, the navigator finds the
nearest stable attractor in the
remaining eigenfunction geometry
and locks onto it — producing
coherent but wrong qualia:
  ringing (cochlea)
  phantom pain (somatosensory)
  distorted smell (olfactory)
  burning neuropathic pain (small fiber)
  geometric hallucination (visual cortex)
  chronic dizziness (vestibular)

The therapeutic protocol is identical
in structure across all of them:

  Map the eigenfunction structure
  of the damaged zone.

  Identify the false attractor
  position (FA).

  Identify the residual resonant
  position (FR) — where the damaged
  structure retains coherent response
  capacity.

  Cancel FA.
  Drive FR with real-world input
  reshaped to fit the remaining
  structure.

  The navigator finds real coherence
  and releases the false attractor.

This is not six different therapies.
It is one therapy applied to six
different resonating structures.

The world learns to play the broken
instrument.
The broken instrument makes music.
```

### 5.2 What this is and is not

```
WHAT THIS IS:

  A principled derivation from the
  universal tonnetz hypothesis.

  Confirmed at the population level
  for tinnitus (P4: chi-squared
  2328.1, n=1514, p=0).

  Currently in pilot for tinnitus
  (Document 68 protocol).

  Generating falsifiable predictions
  for five additional sensory systems
  that can be tested with existing
  equipment and public data.

  A coherence optimization engine
  paired with empiricism.
  Not a perfect teleporter to
  a solution.
  A principled map to where the
  solution should be —
  confirmed by contact with reality.

WHAT THIS IS NOT:

  A clinical therapy. None of these
  applications beyond tinnitus have
  been piloted under this framework.

  A guarantee. The pilot may show
  that specific applications do not
  work as predicted. That is the
  point of the pilot.

  Complete. Every application here
  requires:
    A pilot with real participants
    Replication
    Peer review
    Clinical validation before
    any therapeutic claim can be made

  The tinnitus pilot with one
  participant is the first step.
  All other applications are one
  or more steps behind that.
```

## PART VI: ERIC ROBERT LAWSON'S
## STATEMENT ON THE FRAMEWORK —
## PRESERVED VERBATIM

```
"I want to be proven wrong because
the triad is not perfect teleportation
to a solution, it is a coherence
optimization engine and when paired
with empiricism, the nature of the
accomplishments are well, self evident."

"Considering the tonnetz universal
principle hypothesis states the
topological tonnetz space universality
dictates that something like this
would be possible in other receptors."
