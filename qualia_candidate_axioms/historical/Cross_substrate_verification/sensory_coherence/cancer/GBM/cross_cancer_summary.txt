CROSS-CANCER FALSE ATTRACTOR ANALYSIS
OrganismCore — February 28, 2026
============================================================

THE PRINCIPLE:
  Cancer is a false attractor in the Waddington
  epigenetic landscape. Malignant cells are stuck
  below the differentiation threshold — a ceiling
  imposed by suppression of lineage-specific switch
  genes. The switch genes are identifiable by their
  expression profile: suppressed in the blocked
  population relative to the normal differentiated
  endpoint.

CANCER 1: AML — Acute Myeloid Leukemia
  Lineage:    Myeloid
  Block:      GMP-like vs CD14+ monocytes
  Switch genes (myeloid differentiation):
    SPI1:  90.5% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***
    KLF4:  94.7% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***
    IRF8:  69.5% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***

CANCER 2: CRC — Colorectal Cancer
  Lineage:    Epithelial/Colonocyte
  Block:      Epithelial 2 (cycling) vs Epithelial 1
  Switch genes (colonocyte differentiation):
    CDX2:  79.5% suppressed  p=3.89e-154 ***
  Unexpected: IRF8 elevated 211%
              (lineage infidelity)

CANCER 3: GBM — Glioblastoma
  Lineage:    Neural/Oligodendrocyte
  Block:      OPC-like vs normal oligodendrocytes
  Switch genes (myelination/oligodendrocyte):
    OLIG2   : -21.5% suppressed  p=1.00e+00   [INVERTED]
    SOX10   :  88.6% suppressed  p=5.50e-188 ***  [CONFIRMED]
    MBP     :  89.6% suppressed  p=1.97e-143 ***  [CONFIRMED]
    MOG     :  56.9% suppressed  p=2.97e-91 ***  [CONFIRMED]
    PLP1    :  83.4% suppressed  p=1.27e-280 ***  [CONFIRMED]

  Elevated (false attractor drivers):
    PDGFRA  :  83.1% elevated  [ELEVATED AS PREDICTED]
    SOX2    :  55.7% elevated  [ELEVATED AS PREDICTED]
    EGFR    : 252.2% elevated  [ELEVATED AS PREDICTED]
    NES     : 132.3% elevated  [ELEVATED AS PREDICTED]

  Controls (prior cancer switch genes):
    CDX2    : suppression=-97487.4%  [CONTROL UNEXPECTED]
    SPI1    : suppression=+81.0%  [CONTROL UNEXPECTED]
    KLF4    : suppression=+31.4%  [CONTROL UNEXPECTED]
    IRF8    : suppression=+87.6%  [CONTROL UNEXPECTED]

ZERO GENE OVERLAP (confirmed):
  AML:  SPI1, KLF4, IRF8   — myeloid TFs
  CRC:  CDX2               — colonocyte TF
  GBM:  OLIG2, SOX10, MBP, MOG, PLP1
        — oligodendrocyte/myelin TFs and proteins

  None of these gene sets overlap.
  The framework finds lineage-specific gates
  in each cancer type.
  The lock is the same. The gates are different.

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS:
  AML:  CRISPRa SPI1 + KLF4 + IRF8
  CRC:  CRISPRa CDX2  +  CRISPRi IRF8
  GBM:  CRISPRa [confirmed switch genes above]

  Same intervention logic. Different targets.
  Computable from public data.
  Testable with standard tools.
