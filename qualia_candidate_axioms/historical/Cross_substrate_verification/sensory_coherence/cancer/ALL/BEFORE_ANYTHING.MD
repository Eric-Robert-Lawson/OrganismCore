ALL has two major subtypes:

B-ALL:  B-cell lineage
        Block in B-cell development
        Normal endpoint: mature B cell
        Switch genes predicted:
          PAX5   — B-cell master TF
                   required for all
                   B-cell identity
          EBF1   — early B-cell factor
                   pioneer TF for
                   B-cell commitment
          IKZF1  — Ikaros — lymphoid
                   TF — loss is a
                   hallmark of B-ALL
          CD19   — mature B-cell marker
          MS4A1  — CD20 — terminal
                   B-cell marker

T-ALL:  T-cell lineage
        Block in T-cell development
        Normal endpoint: mature T cell
        Switch genes predicted:
          GATA3  — T-cell master TF
                   (NOTE: also BRCA
                   switch gene — but
                   in a different
                   lineage context.
                   This is the test
                   of lineage specificity
                   — GATA3 in BRCA was
                   luminal epithelial.
                   GATA3 in T-ALL is
                   T-cell. Same gene.
                   Different lineage.
                   Different context.
                   Predicted: suppressed
                   in T-ALL blasts.)
          BCL11B — T-cell commitment TF
          TCF7   — T-cell factor 7
          CD3E   — mature T-cell marker
          TRBC1  — T-cell receptor
                   beta chain — terminal

SCAFFOLD (both):
  CD34   — confirmed scaffold in
           AML and CML — stem marker
  MKI67  — proliferation

CONTROLS:
  CDX2   — confirmed zero in blood
           in AML and CML
  CEBPA  — confirmed myeloid switch
           predicted zero in lymphoid
           If CEBPA is not suppressed
           in ALL — that confirms
           lineage specificity of
           myeloid switch genes
  SFTPC  — confirmed lung only
           predicted zero in blood

CRITICAL TEST:
  CEBPA was confirmed AML/CML switch
  gene at 90%+ suppression.
  In B-ALL or T-ALL:
  CEBPA should be expressed at
  near-zero in BOTH blast and
  normal lymphoid cells.
  If CEBPA is flat in ALL —
  the switch genes are confirmed
  as lineage-specific.
  Myeloid switches do not apply
  to lymphoid cancers.
  The invariant holds.
  The lineage determines the target.
