Unbound sample is removed and staining is accomplished through the binding of streptavidin conjugated phycoerythrin to the hybridized target. Excess label is removed. Washing and staining steps are performed by the Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station using standard protocols.,Arrays are scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G with a 48 array autoloader.
