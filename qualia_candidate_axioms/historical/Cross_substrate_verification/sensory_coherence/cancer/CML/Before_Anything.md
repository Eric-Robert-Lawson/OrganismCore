Lineage:  Myeloid — granulocyte
Driver:   BCR-ABL fusion oncogene
          (Philadelphia chromosome)
Block:    Blast crisis cells cannot
          complete granulocyte
          terminal differentiation

Normal endpoint:
  Mature neutrophil/granulocyte
  CEBPA+ CEBPE+ ELANE+ MPO+ high

False attractor:
  CML blast crisis cells
  Stuck below granulocyte completion
  Proliferating indefinitely

PREDICTED SWITCH GENES:
  CEBPA  — granulocyte master TF
           pioneer factor for myeloid
           terminal differentiation
  CEBPE  — late granulocyte maturation
           expressed only at terminal
           neutrophil completion
  ELANE  — neutrophil elastase
           terminal granule protein
           expressed only in mature
           neutrophils
  MPO    — myeloperoxidase
           confirmed AML ELEVATED
           (GMP marker — scaffold)
           now testing in CML context

SCAFFOLD PREDICTION:
  CD34   — confirmed scaffold AML
           will be elevated in CML
           blast crisis (stem-like)
           NOT a switch gene

CONTROLS (all confirmed Session 1):
  SPI1   — confirmed AML 90.5%
           myeloid TF — watch:
           may CONFIRM in CML too
           (same lineage)
  KLF4   — confirmed AML 94.7%
  IRF8   — confirmed AML 69.5%
  CDX2   — confirmed CRC 79.5%
           predicted zero in blood
  SOX10  — confirmed GBM 88.6%
           predicted zero in blood
  FOXA1  — confirmed BRCA 80.7%
           predicted flat in blood
  SFTPC  — confirmed LUAD 95.7%
           predicted zero in blood

CRITICAL TEST:
  SPI1, KLF4, IRF8 were AML switch
  genes. CML is also myeloid.
  If they are suppressed in CML
  blast crisis — that is the first
  deliberate confirmation of the
  same switch gene set in two
  independent cancers of the
  same lineage.
  The switch genes are a property
  of the lineage. Not the cancer.
  That is the deepest possible
  validation of the invariant.
