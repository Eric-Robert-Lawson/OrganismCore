CLL is a B-cell malignancy.
The most common adult leukemia.

Normal endpoint: mature B cell
                 memory B cell
                 or apoptosis

CLL cells are mature-appearing
CD5+ B cells that accumulate
because they FAIL TO DIE —
not because they proliferate rapidly.

This is a different false attractor
geometry from everything tested so far:

  AML/CML:  blocked before completion
            cells don't differentiate
  B-ALL:    blocked before terminal
            B cell products form
  CLL:      cells APPEAR mature
            but fail apoptosis
            they look like they
            completed — but they
            did not complete the
            final step: programmed
            death

The false attractor in CLL is
the survival attractor —
the cell is stuck in a state
that resembles maturity but
lacks the final apoptotic signal.

PREDICTED SWITCH GENES:

  Terminal apoptosis / exit genes:
    IGHD   — IgD — naive mature B cell
             surface marker
             CLL cells lose IgD
             as they become
             pathologically activated
    FCRL5  — Fc receptor-like 5
             expressed on memory B cells
             mature B cell marker
    CD27   — memory B cell
             (wrong in B-ALL context
              but CLL is different —
              CLL cells are mature-like,
              CD27 may behave differently)
    BTG1   — B cell translocation gene 1
             anti-proliferative
             promotes exit from
             cell cycle
             expressed in quiescent
             mature B cells

  Survival signal:
    BCL2   — anti-apoptotic
             THE hallmark of CLL
             BCL2 is ELEVATED in CLL
             (venetoclax targets BCL2)
             BCL2 should be a SCAFFOLD
             — elevated in CLL
             confirming the survival
             false attractor

CRITICAL TEST:
  IGKC — confirmed B-ALL switch 83.7%
  In CLL: IGKC should be expressed
  CLL cells ARE mature B cells —
  they have completed V(D)J
  recombination.
  If IGKC is expressed in CLL —
  confirms CLL block is AFTER
  IGKC expression (deeper in
  the hierarchy than B-ALL)
  If IGKC is suppressed in CLL —
  CLL and B-ALL share the same block
