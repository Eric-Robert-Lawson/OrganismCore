CROSS-CANCER FALSE ATTRACTOR ANALYSIS
OrganismCore — February 28, 2026
============================================================

CANCER 1: AML — Myeloid
  SPI1: 90.5%  KLF4: 94.7%  IRF8: 69.5%

CANCER 2: CRC — Epithelial/Colonocyte
  CDX2: 79.5%

CANCER 3: GBM — Oligodendrocyte/Neural
  SOX10: 88.6%  MBP: 89.6%
  MOG:   56.9%  PLP1: 83.4%

CANCER 4: BRCA — Luminal Epithelial
  FOXA1   :  80.7% suppressed  p=8.34e-162 ***  [CONFIRMED]
  GATA3   :  53.4% suppressed  p=2.30e-104 ***  [CONFIRMED]
  ESR1    :  96.7% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***  [CONFIRMED]

  Elevated:
  SOX2    :   7.6% elevated  [WEAKLY ELEVATED]
  MYC     :  -9.2% elevated  [NOT ELEVATED]
  EGFR    : 260.1% elevated  [ELEVATED AS PREDICTED]
  KRT5    : 507.9% elevated  [ELEVATED AS PREDICTED]

GENE OVERLAP ACROSS ALL FOUR CANCERS:
  AML:  SPI1, KLF4, IRF8
  CRC:  CDX2
  GBM:  SOX10, MBP, MOG, PLP1
  BRCA: FOXA1, GATA3, ESR1

  Zero overlap.
  Four cancers.
  Four lineages.
  Four completely different switch gene sets.
  One principle.
