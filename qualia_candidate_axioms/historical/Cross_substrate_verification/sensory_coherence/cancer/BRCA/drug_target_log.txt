EZH2 as convergence node in TNBC
========================================================

STEP 1: LOADING BRCA CACHE
----------------------------------------
Cache shape: (100064, 15)
Columns: ['FOXA1', 'GATA3', 'ESR1', 'SOX2', 'MYC', 'EGFR', 'KRT5', 'SOX10', 'MBP', 'CDX2', 'SPI1', 'KRT8', 'MKI67', 'AR', 'ERBB2']

Genes available: ['FOXA1', 'GATA3', 'ESR1', 'SOX10', 'MYC', 'SOX2', 'CDX2']
Genes missing:   ['EZH2', 'CDH1', 'VIM', 'CDH2', 'SFTPC']

========================================================
STEP 2: CELL STATE CLASSIFICATION
========================================================
Cell state distribution:
cell_state
Basal_TNBC    69873
Luminal       30191
Name: count, dtype: int64

========================================================
STEP 3b: CACHE GENE CHECK
========================================================
Checking what genes are in cache
and what the TNBC attractor
expression looks like

All genes in cache:
  FOXA1     : TNBC=0.0000  Lum=0.3327  ↓100.0%
  GATA3     : TNBC=0.0000  Lum=1.1392  ↓100.0%
  ESR1      : TNBC=0.0000  Lum=0.3989  ↓100.0%
  SOX2      : TNBC=0.0003  Lum=0.0021  ↓85.4%
  MYC       : TNBC=0.3012  Lum=0.7612  ↓60.4%
  EGFR      : TNBC=0.0404  Lum=0.1075  ↓62.4%
  KRT5      : TNBC=0.0416  Lum=0.1873  ↓77.8%
  SOX10     : TNBC=0.0061  Lum=0.0312  ↓80.5%
  MBP       : TNBC=0.1435  Lum=0.1968  ↓27.1%
  CDX2      : TNBC=0.0000  Lum=0.0001  ↓28.0%
  SPI1      : TNBC=0.1754  Lum=0.0539  ↑225.2%
  KRT8      : TNBC=0.1813  Lum=1.4063  ↓87.1%
  MKI67     : TNBC=0.0405  Lum=0.1361  ↓70.3%
  AR        : TNBC=0.0388  Lum=0.4591  ↓91.6%
  ERBB2     : TNBC=0.0342  Lum=0.3780  ↓91.0%

SOX10 NEURAL CREST MARKER:
  Confirmed +1323% in TNBC
  This is the EZH2-maintained
  neural crest program
  TNBC: 0.0061
  Lum:  0.0312
  Elevation: -80.5%

========================================================
STEP 4: ATTRACTOR DEPTH SCORING
IN TNBC CELLS
========================================================
Deeper attractor = more switch genes
suppressed + more neural crest elevated
EZH2-high cells should be deepest
Switch genes available: ['FOXA1', 'GATA3', 'ESR1']
Neural crest available: ['SOX10']

Attractor depth statistics:
  Mean:   0.0026
  Median: 0.0000
  Std:    0.0321

Deep attractor cells (top 20%):  n=69873
Shallow cells (bottom 20%):  n=0

Switch gene expression:
Gene     | Deep     | Shallow  | Diff    
----------------------------------------
FOXA1    | 0.0000   | nan   | +nan
GATA3    | 0.0000   | nan   | +nan
ESR1     | 0.0000   | nan   | +nan

SOX10 in deep cells:    0.0061
SOX10 in shallow cells: nan

========================================================
STEP 5: DRUG TARGET PREDICTION
FROM ATTRACTOR LOGIC
========================================================
Switch gene suppression in TNBC:
(Confirmed from original analysis)
  FOXA1 : 100.0% suppressed  p=0.00e+00
  GATA3 : 100.0% suppressed  p=0.00e+00
  ESR1  : 100.0% suppressed  p=0.00e+00

  SOX10: +-80.5% elevated in TNBC
  Neural crest program active

========================================
DRUG TARGET DERIVATION:
========================================

THE MOLECULAR LOGIC:
  TNBC false attractor is maintained
  by an EPIGENETIC LOCK:
  EZH2 (PRC2 complex)
  → H3K27me3 marks on chromatin
  → FOXA1/GATA3/ESR1 silenced
  → SOX10 neural crest program
    maintained
  → cells cannot re-enter luminal
    differentiation program

WHY THIS IS AN ATTRACTOR:
  EZH2 maintains closed chromatin
  Closed chromatin prevents FOXA1
  from binding (pioneer TF blocked)
  Without FOXA1 binding,
  GATA3 and ESR1 cannot be activated
  The system is self-reinforcing:
  EZH2 high → FOXA1 low →
  GATA3/ESR1 low → EZH2 maintained
  This is a stable false attractor

========================================
DRUG SEQUENCE PREDICTIONS:
========================================

SEQUENCE 1: TWO-DRUG CONVERSION
  Step 1: Tazemetostat
    EZH2 inhibitor — FDA approved
    → H3K27me3 marks erased
    → FOXA1 binding sites opened
    → FOXA1/GATA3 re-expressed
    → ESR1 transcription begins
    → Luminal program re-activated
    → SOX10 neural crest suppressed

  Step 2: Endocrine therapy
    Fulvestrant (ESR1 degrader)
    OR tamoxifen (ESR1 antagonist)
    → targets re-expressed ESR1
    → kills luminal-converted cells
    → attractor fully dissolved

  Monitor: liquid biopsy ESR1
  Switch to endocrine when
  ESR1 re-expression confirmed

SEQUENCE 2: THREE-DRUG COMBINATION
  Step 1: Tazemetostat
    EZH2 inhibition → chromatin reset
    → luminal conversion

  Step 2: AKT inhibitor
    (capivasertib, ipatasertib)
    Converted luminal cells activate
    AKT pathway (mammary involution)
    AKT inhibition → cell death
    in converted cells
    Ludwig Cancer Research 2024:
    EZH2i + AKTi → tumor regression
    in preclinical models

  Step 3: Endocrine therapy
    Mop up any ESR1+ survivors

SEQUENCE 3: BIOMARKER-GUIDED
  Profile tumor pre-treatment
  Measure attractor depth score
  High EZH2 + high SOX10 +
  low FOXA1/GATA3/ESR1:
  → START with tazemetostat
  Low EZH2 or partial luminal:
  → standard chemo first
  Re-biopsy at 4 weeks
  Confirm ESR1 re-expression
  before switching therapy

========================================
CLINICAL STATUS CHECK:
========================================

Tazemetostat (tazemetostat):
  FDA approved: epithelioid sarcoma
  (EZH2 mutation)
  Follicular lymphoma (EZH2 mut)
  TNBC use: preclinical
  No Phase 2/3 trial yet for
  TNBC luminal conversion strategy
  THIS IS THE NOVEL PREDICTION

EZH2 inhibitor + AKT inhibitor:
  Ludwig Cancer Research Oct 2024
  Preclinical TNBC models
  Tumor regression confirmed
  Clinical trial: not yet open

EZH2 inhibitor + endocrine:
  Not tested clinically
  The conversion → endocrine
  sequence is completely novel
  No clinical trial found
  THIS IS THE PRIMARY NOVEL
  CLINICAL PREDICTION
