ESCC PREDICTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════

CELL OF ORIGIN:
  Stratified squamous epithelium
  of the mid and upper esophagus.
  Basal layer → suprabasal →
  spinous → granular → cornified.
  Normal squamous differentiation
  is driven by:
    TP63 / TP73 — basal identity TFs
    KRT5 / KRT14 — basal keratins
    KRT1 / KRT10 — suprabasal keratins
    SPRR family — cornified envelope
    NOTCH1/NOTCH2 — differentiation
    EGFR — basal proliferation signal

PREDICTED BLOCK LEVEL:
  ESCC cells retain basal squamous
  identity (KRT5/KRT14 positive)
  but cannot complete differentiation
  to cornified squamous epithelium.
  Block is at the basal→suprabasal
  checkpoint — the same checkpoint
  where SOX2 amplification (3q)
  and TP63 amplification (3q) lock
  cells in a basal proliferative state.

  NOTE: SOX2 was found elevated
  +54.1% in STAD.
  SOX2 is on chromosome 3q.
  3q amplification is a known
  feature of ESCC.
  ESCC may share SOX2 amplification
  with STAD but via a different
  cell context and a different
  attractor architecture.
  This is a cross-cancer test.

PREDICTED SWITCH GENES (ESCC):
  NOTCH1  — squamous differentiation TF
             suppressed in ESCC
             NOTCH1 loss is a known
             feature of ESCC
             predicted: DOWN
  KRT1    — suprabasal keratin
             terminal differentiation marker
             predicted: DOWN in tumor
  KRT10   — suprabasal keratin
             terminal differentiation
             predicted: DOWN in tumor
  SPRR1A  — cornified envelope protein
             terminal squamous marker
             predicted: DOWN in tumor
  LORICRIN — terminal cornification
              predicted: DOWN in tumor

PREDICTED FALSE ATTRACTOR (ESCC):
  SOX2    — basal pluripotency TF
             3q amplification in ESCC
             predicted: UP in tumor
  TP63    — basal squamous TF
             3q amplification in ESCC
             predicted: UP in tumor
  KRT5    — basal keratin
             predicted: retained/UP
  KRT14   — basal keratin
             predicted: retained/UP
  EGFR    — basal proliferation
             predicted: UP in tumor
  CCND1   — cyclin D1
             11q amplification in ESCC
             predicted: UP in tumor

PREDICTED EPIGENETIC (ESCC):
  EZH2 elevated — gain of function lock
  Same pattern as BRCA/PAAD/PRAD.
  Squamous cancers with 3q amplification
  typically have EZH2 gain of function.
  Predicted: UP in tumor.

PREDICTED DRUG TARGETS (ESCC):
  EGFR — cetuximab / erlotinib
  CCND1/CDK4/6 — CDK4/6 inhibitor
  EZH2 — tazemetostat
  NOTCH activator — gamma secretase
                    inhibitor pathway
  SOX2/TP63 — no direct drug
               depth score selection

EAC PREDICTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════

CELL OF ORIGIN:
  Barrett's esophagus —
  columnar intestinal metaplasia
  of the distal esophagus.
  Normal esophageal squamous
  epithelium → GERD-driven →
  Barrett's columnar metaplasia →
  dysplasia → adenocarcinoma.

  IMPORTANT CONNECTION TO STAD:
  Barrett's metaplasia involves
  CDX2 expression — the same
  intestinal TF found with broken
  circuit in STAD.
  EAC arises from intestinal
  metaplasia of the esophagus —
  identical cellular context to
  the CDX2-driven intestinal
  metaplasia that precedes STAD.
  EAC and STAD may share attractor
  architecture because they share
  the same preneoplastic state
  (intestinal metaplasia / CDX2+).

PREDICTED BLOCK LEVEL:
  EAC cells are stuck in a
  Barrett's/columnar intestinal
  identity — the same false attractor
  as intestinal-type STAD.
  CDX2 elevated but circuit broken.
  ERBB2 amplified in a subset
  (higher rate than STAD — ~30% EAC).
  The EAC attractor may be the
  deepest in the ESCA cohort —
  more aggressive than ESCC on average.

PREDICTED SWITCH GENES (EAC):
  NOTCH1  — differentiation signal
             predicted: DOWN
  CDH1    — epithelial identity
             predicted: DOWN at protein
             level (expression may be
             preserved — same caveat
             as STAD diffuse histology)
  KLF4    — columnar differentiation TF
             predicted: DOWN
  MUC6    — gastric mucin
             predicted: DOWN

PREDICTED FALSE ATTRACTOR (EAC):
  CDX2    — intestinal TF
             same broken circuit as STAD
             predicted: UP but uncoupled
  ERBB2   — HER2 amplification ~30% EAC
             predicted: UP in subset
  MUC2    — intestinal mucin
             predicted: UP
  ZEB1    — EMT TF
             predicted: UP
  AURKA   — mitotic kinase
             predicted: UP
             if EAC shares ZEB2/AURKA
             coupling with STAD this
             would be the most important
             cross-cancer confirmation
             in this series

PREDICTED EPIGENETIC (EAC):
  EZH2 elevated — same as BRCA/PAAD.
  EAC is a CIN-type cancer similar
  to intestinal-type STAD.
  Predicted: UP.

PREDICTED DRUG TARGETS (EAC):
  ERBB2 — trastuzumab (already approved
           in EAC — same as STAD)
  AURKA — alisertib
           if ZEB2-AURKA coupling
           holds in EAC as in STAD
           this is the framework's
           strongest cross-cancer
           prediction in this series
  CDK4/6 — palbociclib
  VEGFR2 — ramucirumab
            already approved in EAC

CROSS-SUBTYPE PREDICTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════

PREDICTION 1 — DEPTH SEPARATION:
  ESCC and EAC will have different
  mean depth scores.
  EAC predicted deeper (more similar
  to STAD attractor).
  ESCC predicted shallower (squamous
  block is at differentiation
  not proliferative activation).

PREDICTION 2 — ZEB2-AURKA IN EAC:
  If the ZEB2-AURKA coupling r=0.9871
  found in STAD is a feature of
  the columnar/intestinal metaplasia
  attractor — it should replicate in EAC.
  It should NOT appear in ESCC
  which has a different cell of origin.
  This is a specific testable
  cross-cancer geometric prediction.
  r(ZEB2, AURKA) in EAC: predicted > 0.80
  r(ZEB2, AURKA) in ESCC: predicted < 0.50

PREDICTION 3 — CDX2 CIRCUIT IN EAC:
  CDX2 circuit broken in STAD.
  CDX2 circuit predicted broken in EAC.
  Same preneoplastic context
  (intestinal metaplasia) should
  produce same broken CDX2 circuit.
  This would confirm the CDX2
  broken circuit is a feature of
  the intestinal metaplasia attractor
  not specific to STAD.

PREDICTION 4 — SOX2 IN ESCC NOT EAC:
  SOX2 amplification is a feature
  of squamous cancers (3q gain).
  Predicted: SOX2 elevated in ESCC.
  Predicted: SOX2 NOT elevated in EAC.
  If the geometry confirms this
  separation — it validates that
  SOX2 elevation in STAD (Script 3)
  was detecting a squamous-like
  subpopulation or a different
  mechanism than 3q amplification.

PREDICTION 5 — SURVIVAL:
  TCGA-ESCA has survival data.
  Depth score by subtype should
  predict survival within each subtype.
  Deeper = worse OS.
  This is the STAD survival test
  that could not be run from
  the series matrix.
  It can be run here.
