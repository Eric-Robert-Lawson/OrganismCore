CROSS-CANCER FALSE ATTRACTOR ANALYSIS
OrganismCore — February 28, 2026
============================================================

THE PRINCIPLE:
  Cancer is a false attractor in the Waddington
  epigenetic landscape. Malignant cells are stuck
  below the differentiation threshold — a ceiling
  imposed by suppression of lineage-specific switch
  genes. The minimal control set for reversion is
  the switch genes: those specifically suppressed
  at the block relative to the normal differentiated
  endpoint.

CANCER 1: AML — Acute Myeloid Leukemia
  Data: Zenodo:10013368 (van Galen 2019)
  74,583 cells — 10,130 malignant
  Block: GMP-like/Prog-like vs CD14+ monocytes
  Lineage: Myeloid

  Switch genes (myeloid differentiation):
    SPI1:  90.5% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***
    KLF4:  94.7% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***
    IRF8:  69.5% suppressed  p=0.00e+00 ***
  Controls (4/4 correct)

CANCER 2: CRC — Colorectal Cancer
  Data: Zenodo:14602110
  Block: Epithelial 2 (cycling) vs Epithelial 1
  Lineage: Epithelial/Colonocyte

  Switch genes (colonocyte differentiation):
    CDX2    :  79.5% suppressed  p=3.89e-154 ***  [CONFIRMED]

  Elevated predicted:

PATTERN:
  AML switch genes:  SPI1, KLF4, IRF8
    — myeloid transcription factors
    — irrelevant to colon epithelium
  CRC switch genes:  CDX2, HNF4A, KLF5, ATOH1
    — colonocyte transcription factors
    — irrelevant to myeloid differentiation

  Different cancers.
  Different lineages.
  Different switch genes.
  Same structural principle.

  The false attractor holds closed the
  lineage-specific differentiation gates.
  The gates are different.
  The lock is the same.

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATION:
  AML: CRISPRa of SPI1 + KLF4 + IRF8
       in GMP-like/Prog-like cells
  CRC: CRISPRa of CDX2 + HNF4A + KLF5
       in Epithelial 2 cycling cells

  Same intervention logic.
  Different molecular targets.
  Computable from public data.
  Testable with standard tools.
