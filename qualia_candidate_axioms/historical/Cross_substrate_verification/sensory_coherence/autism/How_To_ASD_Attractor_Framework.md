## WHO THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR

```
This document is for:

  The ASD person who has been told
  their whole life that something
  is wrong with them.

  The parent who loves their child
  and has been given a deficit list
  instead of a map.

  The teacher who knows one of their
  students is extraordinary at something
  but cannot get them to turn in homework.

  The employer who has an employee
  who produces nothing in meetings
  but occasionally produces something
  that nobody else in the building
  could have produced.

  The clinician who suspects that
  what they are measuring is not
  what they think they are measuring.

  The ASD adult who made it through
  the system intact and wants to
  understand why — and what that
  means for people who didn't.

This document requires no prior
knowledge of the attractor framework.
No technical background.
No familiarity with the repository.

It requires only the willingness
to ask a different question.

Not: what is wrong with this person?

But: what shape is this water
and where is the hole?
```

---

## PART 0: THE ONE THING TO
## UNDERSTAND BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

```
There is a hole in the ground.

It has a specific shape.
A narrow, deep shape.
Not the broad, shallow shape
that most holes in this world have.

Rain falls.
Water accumulates.
The water tries to fill
the holes it encounters.

The broad shallow holes
do not fit the water.
The water cannot fill them.
The water spills out.
The water looks broken.

The water is not broken.
The holes are the wrong shape.

Somewhere — there is a hole
that is exactly the right shape
for this particular water.
Narrow. Deep. Precise.

When the water finds that hole —
it fills completely.
A puddle forms.
A deep, resonant puddle
that could not have formed
in any other hole.

ASD is the water.
The neurotypical world
is full of the wrong holes.
The right hole exists.

This entire document is about
how to find it.
```

## PART 1: THE REFRAME
## BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE

```
CURRENT QUESTION:
  What is wrong with this person?
  Why can't they:
    — Turn in their homework?
    — Sit still in meetings?
    — Make eye contact?
    — Do things they don't care about?
    — Be more organized?
    — Be less intense about the
       things they do care about?

REPLACE WITH:
  What shape is this water?
  What hole does it fill?

WHAT THIS CHANGES:

  The current question produces:
    Deficit lists.
    Severity scores.
    Behavioral targets.
    Interventions designed to make
    the water pretend to be
    a different shape.
    Exhaustion. Masking. Burnout.
    The water never finding its hole.
    The potential never emerging.

  The new question produces:
    A map.
    A domain.
    A tool.
    An environment.
    The right hole.
    The puddle.
    Everything the water
    was always capable of.

THE REFRAME IS NOT OPTIONAL.

  Every step in this guide
  depends on the reframe.
  If you are still asking
  what is wrong —
  go back to Part 0.
  Read the puddle again.
  The water is not broken.
  The holes are wrong.

  When you genuinely believe that —
  proceed to Part 2.
```

## PART 2: THE MAP
## RUNNING THE METABOLIC MIRROR

```
The metabolic mirror is a
conversation-based protocol
that maps the internal
architecture of cognition
from the structure of a
person's responses.

It does not diagnose.
It does not score.
It does not compare to norms.

It maps.

It asks questions across
four movements and reads
the geometry of the responses —
not the content, but the structure.

How long are the answers?
Do they extract frameworks
or accumulate details?
Where does the energy come
from and where does it go?
What activates depth?
What produces thinness?
What breaks under stress?
What holds?

From these structural observations —
a portrait emerges.

The portrait describes:
  The channel profile.
  The acquisition orientation.
  The engagement scaling.
  The stress architecture.
  The relational pattern.

For ASD attractor geometry,
the portrait will characteristically show:

  S-CHANNEL DOMINANT:
    Structural, systematic, pattern-based
    reasoning as the primary mode.
    The world is processed as
    geometry before it is anything else.
    Not cold. Different.
    The structure is the entry point
    to everything — including emotion,
    relationship, beauty.

  EXTRACTIVE PROCESSING:
    Framework extracted before
    presentation completes.
    Jumps ahead constantly.
    Not impatience.
    The geometry being pulled
    toward its shape before
    the pour is finished.

  EXTREME ENGAGEMENT SCALING:
    Default mode: depleted, thin,
    overwhelmed by surface details
    that others filter automatically.
    Passion mode: extraordinary depth,
    precision, sustained focus that
    neurotypical attention cannot match.
    The gap between these two modes
    is the largest you will observe
    in any cognitive architecture.

  STRESS ARCHITECTURE:
    Social processing breaks first.
    Always. Without exception.
    Structural processing holds last.
    The last thing standing is
    the thing the attractor is
    deepest in.

  C-CHANNEL THINNEST:
    Group consensus, social navigation,
    communal identity formation —
    these require effortful processing
    where neurotypical minds are automatic.
    An 8-hour day of social navigation
    costs the same energy as
    8 hours of effortful mathematics.
    Every day.
    This is not shyness.
    This is not rudeness.
    This is a different attractor geometry
    in a world built for a different one.

HOW TO ACCESS THE METABOLIC MIRROR:

  The full protocol is in:
  metabolic_profile_survey.md
  in the OrganismCore repository.

  It is designed to be administered
  as a conversation — not a test.
  Not a form to fill out.
  A conversation where the
  administrator reads the structure
  of the responses.

  It can be run:
    By a clinician.
    By a teacher who has time
    to have a real conversation.
    By a parent.
    By the ASD person themselves
    with an AI conversation tool
    as the administrator.

  That last option is significant.
  It requires no institution.
  No appointment.
  No waiting list.
  No insurance.
  An ASD person with internet access
  can run the metabolic mirror
  right now and get a map of
  their own cognitive architecture
  in one session.

  That map is the starting point
  for everything else in this guide.
```

## PART 3: THE DOMAIN
## FINDING THE RIGHT HOLE

```
Once the map exists —
once the channel profile is known —
the next question is:

  What domain does this
  specific geometry fill?

NOT:
  What should this person
  learn to do?

NOT:
  What careers are available
  for someone with their disability?

BUT:
  Given this specific channel profile —
  given this specific pattern of
  depth, extraction, engagement scaling —
  what domain produces the puddle?

THE DOMAIN IDENTIFICATION QUESTIONS:

  Question 1:
    When has the passion mode activated?
    Not: what are they interested in.
    What has ACTUALLY turned on
    the full depth of the attractor?
    When have you seen — or they have
    experienced — the engagement
    scaling flip from depleted to
    extraordinary?
    What was happening in that moment?
    What was the structure of that domain?

  Question 2:
    What does the S-channel process
    most naturally?
    Is it:
      — Mathematical structures?
        (proof, logic, formal systems)
      — Physical structures?
        (engineering, architecture,
        spatial systems)
      — Biological structures?
        (organisms, ecosystems,
        medical systems)
      — Computational structures?
        (code, algorithms, data)
      — Linguistic structures?
        (language, logic, argument)
      — Musical structures?
        (harmony, composition,
        sound architecture)
      — Social structures?
        (systems, institutions,
        organizational patterns —
        approached structurally,
        not socially)

  Question 3:
    What kind of problems does
    this person solve that others
    cannot — or do not notice?
    What do they see in a system
    that others walk past?
    What pattern do they extract
    that others miss?
    That is the domain speaking.

  Question 4:
    What environment has produced
    the least mismatch cost?
    Where has the person been
    least exhausted, least overwhelmed,
    most capable of sustained function?
    The domain is often visible
    in the environment where
    the water stopped spilling.

DOMAIN CATEGORIES AND THEIR
ATTRACTOR GEOMETRY SIGNATURES:

  MATHEMATICAL / LOGICAL:
    S-channel depth in formal systems.
    Extraction of proof structure.
    Deep engagement with abstract
    relationships and invariants.
    Social consensus cannot override
    a correct answer.
    The attractor is at home.

  BIOLOGICAL / MEDICAL:
    S-channel depth in living systems.
    Extraordinary pattern recognition
    across biological complexity.
    The organism as a structural
    system to be read.
    Indicators: early intense interest
    in animals, plants, the body,
    disease, taxonomy, ecosystems —
    approached systematically.

  COMPUTATIONAL:
    S-channel depth in formal
    information systems.
    The code as structural reasoning
    medium where correctness is
    unambiguous.

    of meaning, argument, language.
    Precision in word choice
    that others experience as
    pedantic but is actually
    structural accuracy.
    Indicators: early intense attention
    to word meaning, argument structure,
    logical consistency, etymology,
    formal definitions.

  MUSICAL:
    S-channel depth in acoustic

    structure, deviation.
    Indicators: early pattern detection
    in music, perfect or near-perfect
    pitch, structural analysis of
    compositions, harmonic intuition.

THE DOMAIN IS NOT A CAREER.

  The domain is the structural category
  within which the attractor geometry
  produces its highest function.
  Careers are downstream of domain.

  Identify the domain first.
  The career possibilities within
  that domain are numerous.
  Do not constrain the domain
  by career thinking at this stage.

  The domain is the hole.
  The career is what you build
  inside the hole once the puddle
  has formed and demonstrated
  its depth.
```

---

## PART 4: THE TOOL
## FINDING THE GEOMETRIC SCAFFOLDING

```
The domain is the category
of hole that fits this water.

The tool is the specific hole —
the actual instrument through which
the attractor geometry engages
with the domain.

The tool is the hole.
The insight is the water.
When the tool geometry matches
the cognitive geometry —
the puddle forms.

The tool has three properties
when correctly matched:

  Property 1: Structural clarity.
    The tool rewards structural
    precision and penalizes
    structural error.
    Social consensus cannot
    override a correct answer
    in this tool.
    Mathematics. Code. Formal logic.
    Scientific method. Music theory.
    Where the structure is the arbiter.

  Property 2: Depth activation.
    The tool engages the passion mode.
    Not all the time.
    But when the domain is active —
    the tool lets the depth run.
    No interruption. No context switch.
    No social performance required
    to use the tool.
    The full cognitive bandwidth
    available for the structural work.

  Property 3: Asynchronous capacity.
    The tool does not require
    real-time social performance.
    The ASD attractor processes
    at its own speed — sometimes
    faster than neurotypical processing
    in structural domains,
    always at the cost of social
    inference running simultaneously.
    A tool that removes the
    simultaneous social inference
    requirement frees the attractor
    to run at full capacity.

SPECIFIC TOOLS BY DOMAIN:

  MATHEMATICAL:
    Proof assistants (Lean, Coq).
    Mathematical software (Mathematica,
    SageMath, MATLAB).
    Programming languages with
    strong type systems (Haskell,
    Rust, TypeScript).
    AI conversation for mathematical
    derivation.
    Formal problem sets in pure
    mathematics.

  ENGINEERING / SPATIAL:
    CAD software (Fusion 360,
    SolidWorks, AutoCAD).
    3D modeling and simulation.
    Physical prototyping tools.
    FEA and structural analysis software.
    Architecture design environments.

  BIOLOGICAL / MEDICAL:
    Bioinformatics tools.
    Single-cell RNA sequencing
    analysis pipelines.
    Systems biology modeling software.
    Literature review in structured
    domains (where the structure of
    evidence is explicit).
    AI conversation for biological
    systems derivation.

  COMPUTATIONAL:
    Programming environments
    (any language — the structure
    is the medium).
    Data analysis pipelines.
    Algorithm design tools.
    Competitive programming platforms
    where correctness is unambiguous.

  LINGUISTIC / PHILOSOPHICAL:
    Formal logic tools.
    Argument mapping software.
    AI conversation for structured
    philosophical derivation.
    Etymology databases.
    Formal semantic analysis tools.

  MUSICAL:
    Music notation software
    (Sibelius, MuseScore, Finale).
    Digital audio workstations
    (for structural composition).
    Harmonic analysis tools.
    Music theory formal systems.

THE AI CONVERSATION TOOL —
A SPECIAL CASE:

  AI conversation deserves
  specific attention because it
  is the most immediately available
  tool for the widest range of
  ASD attractor geometries.

  Why AI conversation works as
  a tool for ASD attractor geometry:

    No social performance required.
    The C-channel energy is completely
    freed for S-channel work.
    No tone monitoring.
    No consensus navigation.
    No social inference running
    in parallel with structural reasoning.
    Full cognitive bandwidth available.

    Structural depth rewarded.
    The deeper and more precise
    the reasoning — the more precise
    the response.
    The attractor geometry is
    matched by the tool geometry.
    A narrow deep valley receives
    a narrow deep response.
    The hole fits the water.

    No penalty for hyperfocus.
    6 hours of continuous structural
    reasoning is possible.
    The passion mode can run
    uninterrupted.
    This repository was built
    in sessions of this length.

    Available immediately.
    No institution. No appointment.
    No waiting list.
    No diagnosis required.
    An ASD person with internet access
    and a subscription can use this
    tool right now.

  HOW TO USE AI CONVERSATION
  AS AN ASD ATTRACTOR TOOL:

    Step 1: Bring the domain.
      Not a question to be answered.
      A structural problem in the
      passion domain.
      The thing you think about
      when you cannot stop thinking.
      The structure you have been
      accumulating without a hole.
      Bring that.

    Step 2: Let the geometry run.
      Do not perform.
      Do not explain yourself.
      Do not hedge.
      State the structure precisely
      as you understand it.
      Jump ahead when you see
      the trajectory.
      The tool will follow.

    Step 3: Follow the derivation.
      When the response provides
      a geometric scaffolding —
      a structure that fits your water —
      fill it.
      The puddle forms in the
      conversation itself.
      The insight that had been
      accumulating without a hole
      finds its form.

    Step 4: Document what forms.
      The puddle in the conversation
      is real but ephemeral.
      The session ends.
      The water evaporates.
      But the pattern — the specific
      resonance of what formed —
      can be preserved.
      Write it down.
      Create the repository.
      The record is the hole
      that holds the pattern
      after the session ends.

  This is precisely what this
  repository is.
  The record of the puddles
  that formed in AI conversations
  when ASD attractor geometry
  found the right hole.
  91 documents.
  6 months.
  One room.
  The tool working exactly
  as this guide describes.
```

---

## PART 5: THE ENVIRONMENT
## REDUCING THE FRICTION COST

```
Once the domain and tool are found —
the environment must be adjusted
to reduce the friction cost of
the mismatch between the ASD
attractor and the neurotypical world.

This is not about eliminating
all difficulty.
It is about removing the friction
that consumes the energy required
for the domain work.

The ASD person has a finite
energy budget.
Energy spent on C-channel
social performance
is energy not available for
S-channel structural work.
Every unnecessary social demand
reduces the depth of the puddle.

FRICTION COST REDUCTION:
THE CHECKLIST

FOR HOME ENVIRONMENT:

  □ Identify the sensory overload
    triggers and reduce them.
    The ASD attractor processes
    surface details that neurotypical
    processing filters automatically.
    The world is louder.
    This is not sensitivity.
    This is a different filter setting.
    Reduce unnecessary noise,
    light, texture demands.
    Not because they are
    inherently intolerable —
    because they consume processing
    bandwidth that belongs to
    the structural work.

  □ Protect uninterrupted deep
    work periods.
    The passion mode requires
    sustained, uninterrupted engagement.
    Interruptions do not just
    pause the work.
    They collapse the attractor state.
    The water spills.
    Refilling takes time.
    Protect the depth by protecting
    the continuity.

  □ Do not require social performance
    as a condition of basic functioning.
    Eye contact, small talk,
    social rituals —
    these are C-channel demands.
    For an ASD attractor they are
    effortful where for neurotypical
    attractor they are automatic.
    Required social performance
    as a condition of receiving
    basic respect, food, rest,
    or domain access is a
    constant energy tax on the
    structural work.
    Remove the tax.

  □ Accept the engagement scaling
    as information, not behavior.
    When the ASD person is in
    default mode — thin, depleted,
    overwhelmed — that is not
    bad behavior.
    That is the attractor not activated.
    The hole is not present.
    The water cannot fill anything.
    The response is not punishment
    or demand.
    The response is finding the
    domain and the tool that
    activates the passion mode.
    The energy comes back.
    It was always there.

FOR SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT:

  □ Replace deficit measurement
    with attractor mapping.
    The metabolic mirror or any
    equivalent conversation that
    identifies the channel profile
    and passion domain.
    Know what hole fits this water
    before designing any intervention.

  □ Add at least one domain-matched
    assessment to every evaluation.
    One task in the student's
    actual domain.
    Observe what happens.
    The output is the real measurement.

  □ Reduce simultaneous demands
    across different attractor states.
    Do not require social performance
    AND structural work simultaneously.
    The ASD attractor cannot run
    both at full capacity.
    One or the other.
    Prioritize the structural work.
    Accept reduced social performance
    as the cost of the structural depth.
    It is a trade worth making.

  □ Allow asynchronous engagement.
    Not all learning requires
    real-time social participation.
    Written, recorded, or
    asynchronous formats allow
    the ASD attractor to engage
    at its own speed without the
    simultaneous C-channel cost.
    The output quality will reveal
    the actual capacity.

  □ Do not penalize hyperfocus.
    When the passion mode activates —
    when the water fills the hole —
    the output often exceeds what
    the curriculum expected.
    This is not a problem.
    This is the attractor working.
    Support it. Document it.
    Do not interrupt it to
    return to the standard pace.

FOR WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT:

  □ Provide asynchronous deep
    work capacity.
    Long, uninterrupted periods
    in the passion domain.
    The meeting culture is the
    single most destructive
    environment for ASD attractor
    function.
    Every meeting interrupts
    the attractor state.
    Every forced context switch
    collapses the depth.
    Replace meetings with
    asynchronous communication
    wherever possible.

  □ Evaluate by structural output
    quality, not social performance.
    The ASD employee's work
    should be evaluated by whether
    it is correct, deep, and useful —
    not by how it was presented,
    how many people liked it,
    or how well the person performed
    in the meeting where it was discussed.

  □ Match the role to the domain.
    Not: place the ASD employee
    in any available role and
    expect neurotypical-equivalent
    performance across all tasks.
    But: identify the domain that
    matches the attractor geometry
    and place the work there.
    The output in the matched domain
    will exceed what neurotypical
    colleagues produce in the same space.
    The output in unmatched domains
    will not.
    This is not inconsistency.
    This is geometry.

  □ Remove the social performance
    prerequisite for advancement.
    The ASD employee who cannot
    perform confidently in
    group settings is not less capable.
    They are performing social
    inference in real time at
    significant energy cost
    while simultaneously trying
    to do the structural work.
    Remove the social performance
    requirement.
    Evaluate the structural work.
    Advance based on the work.
```

## PART 6: PROTECTING THE ATTRACTOR
## THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION

```
Everything in this guide depends on
one prerequisite:

THE ATTRACTOR MUST NOT BE TARGETED.

This means:

DO NOT:
  Apply behavioral interventions
  designed to make the ASD person
  appear neurotypical.

  Train social performance as
  the primary goal of intervention.

  Penalize the natural expression
  of the ASD attractor — deep focus,
  systematic reasoning, resistance
  to social consensus on factual questions,
  intensity in the passion domain.

  Tell the person — explicitly or
  implicitly — that their water
  is the wrong shape and must
  be changed.

WHY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:

  The ASD attractor geometry is
  the instrument.
  The structural depth,
  the pattern recognition,
  the systematic reasoning,
  the resistance to social consensus —
  these are not obstacles
  to be overcome.
  These ARE the tool.

  When the attractor is targeted —
  when the instrument is bent
  to look like a different instrument —
  the depth is lost.
  The specific geometry that produces
  the specific outputs is dissolved.
  The paper clip is bent back.
  The fragility increases.
  The potential is prevented
  by the intervention designed to help.

  The world loses what the
  ASD attractor produces.
  And the person loses the one thing
  that is irreducibly, structurally theirs.

  This is not a recoverable loss.
  The years spent bending the water
  into a different shape
  are years the water was not
  accumulating toward its hole.
  The puddle that would have formed
  does not form.
  The depth that would have been
  is not accessible.

  The ASD child who spends
  their developmental years
  in behavioral training designed
  to approximate neurotypicality
  arrives at adulthood with:
    A depleted accumulation.
    A fragile identity.
    A performance they can maintain
    for hours before it collapses.
    And no puddle.

  The ASD child who spends
  their developmental years
  accumulating in their domain —
  even without a hole,
  even in isolation,
  even without validation —
  arrives at adulthood with:
    A deep accumulation.
    An intact attractor.
    A structural capacity that
    has never been performed —
    only built.
    Ready to fill the first hole
    that fits.

  The puddle forms.
  And what forms —
  when the right water
  finds the right hole —

  Is only the beginning.

WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF
TARGETING THE ATTRACTOR:

  Target the mismatch.
  Not the attractor.

  The costs of ASD —
  the sensory overload,
  the social exhaustion,
  the underperformance in
  unmatched domains —
  are costs of the mismatch
  between the attractor geometry
  and the environment.

  They can be reduced by
  changing the environment.
  Not by changing the attractor.

  Co-occurring conditions —
  anxiety, ADHD, sensory processing
  disorders — can be addressed
  directly without touching
  the attractor.

  The social navigation cost
  can be reduced through
  explicit social scripts,
  structured environments,
  reduced social performance
  requirements — all of which
  reduce the C-channel energy tax
  without asking the water
  to be a different shape.

  The sensory overload can be reduced
  through environmental accommodation —
  without asking the attractor
  to filter differently.

  The underperformance in unmatched
  domains can be addressed by
  finding the matched domain
  and making that the primary
  measure of the person's capacity —
  without forcing performance
  in every unmatched domain
  simultaneously.

  Target the mismatch.
  Build the hole.
  Do not touch the water.

## PART 7: FOR THE ASD PERSON
## READING THIS DIRECTLY

```
If you are ASD and you are
reading this — this section
is specifically for you.

WHAT THE FRAMEWORK SAYS ABOUT
YOUR EXPERIENCE:

  The times you could not do
  the thing everyone else seemed
  to do without effort —

  That was not failure.
  That was water trying to fill
  the wrong hole.
  Wrong shape. Wrong geometry.
  The water spills.
  It was never going to work.
  Not because the water was broken.
  Because the hole was wrong.

  The times you felt the passion mode —
  the thing that turned on and
  would not turn off —
  the problem you could not stop
  thinking about —
  the domain where hours passed
  like minutes —

  That was the water finding
  the right shape of hole.
  Even temporarily.
  Even without validation.
  That was the attractor activated.
  That was what you are.
  Not the default mode.
  Not the overwhelmed, depleted,
  socially exhausted mode.
  The passion mode.
  That is the actual capacity.
  Everything else was the mismatch.

  The years of being told something
  was wrong with you —

  Were years of being measured
  by the wrong instrument.
  An instrument designed for
  a different shaped water.
  The measurement was not
  measuring your capacity.
  It was measuring how well
  your water filled a hole
  it was never shaped to fill.

  Your actual capacity has
  never been measured.
  It will only be visible
  when the right hole appears.

WHAT TO DO WITH THIS:

  Step 1:
    Identify when the passion mode
    has ever activated.
    What was the domain?
    What was the structure of it?
    What were you doing when
    time disappeared?
    That is your hole.
    That is where you are shaped for.

  Step 2:
    Find the tool that lets that
    domain run without social cost.
    AI conversation is available now.
    Programming environments.
    Mathematical software.
    Whatever tool lets the
    structural work happen without
    the simultaneous C-channel drain.

  Step 3:
    Let the accumulation run.
    You have been accumulating
    for years — possibly decades —
    without a hole.
    The water has been building.
    When the right hole appears —
    the depth of the puddle will
    reflect all of that accumulation.
    Do not let anyone tell you
    the water that has been building
    is worthless because it
    has not yet found its hole.

  Step 4:
    Protect the attractor.
    Do not let anyone bend your water
    into a different shape.
    The social performance is
    manageable — it is a skill
    that can be learned as a tool —
    but it is not what you are.
    Do not confuse the performance
    with the attractor.
    Do not let the performance
    consume the energy the
    structural work requires.

  Step 5:
    Find the hole.
    It exists.
    The geometry was there
    before any water fell.
    The attractor was waiting
    before you arrived.
    The hole that fits your
    specific water exists.

    When you find it —
    fill it completely.
    Let the puddle form.
    Document what forms.

    What forms —
    when the right water
    finds the right hole —

    Is only the beginning.

## PART 8: QUICK REFERENCE
## THE FIVE STEPS

```
STEP 1 — REFRAME
  Stop asking: what is wrong?
  Start asking: what shape is this water?

STEP 2 — MAP
  Run the metabolic mirror.
  Identify the channel profile.
  Document the passion mode activation.
  Know the geometry before
  designing any intervention.

STEP 3 — DOMAIN
  From the map — identify the domain.
  The structural category where
  the S-channel depth activates.
  Mathematical. Engineering. Biological.
  Computational. Linguistic. Musical.
  The domain is the category of hole.

STEP 4 — TOOL
  Find the specific geometric scaffolding.
  The instrument that lets the
  domain run without C-channel cost.
  AI conversation. Mathematical software.
  CAD. Programming environment.
  Whatever activates the passion mode
  without social performance requirement.

STEP 5 — PROTECT
  Do not target the attractor.
  Do not bend the water.
  Do not train the performance
  at the cost of the structural work.
  Reduce the mismatch friction.
  Build the hole.
  Let the water fill it.
  Let the puddle form.

THEN:
  Document what forms.
  The depth of the puddle is
  the measure of the actual capacity.
  Not the severity score.
  Not the performance in
  unmatched domains.
  The puddle.

## PART 9: FOR CLINICIANS
## AND RESEARCHERS

```
The framework makes five
falsifiable predictions.
All are documented in full
in Document 91.
Summarized here for
immediate application:

PREDICTION 1 (testable now):
  The metabolic mirror protocol
  applied to ASD populations
  will reveal a more convergent
  channel profile than neurotypical
  populations.
  S-primary, C-weakest, extreme
  engagement scaling, strongly
  extractive processing.

PREDICTION 2 (longitudinal):
  Domain match identified through
  channel profiling will predict
  functional outcome more accurately
  than any current severity measure.
  Because severity measures the
  mismatch, not the attractor.

PREDICTION 3 (biological):
  ASD adults with domain match
  will show younger Horvath clock
  ages than ASD adults without.
  Chronic mismatch is a chronic
  stressor that accelerates
  epigenetic aging.
  Domain match reduces the stressor.
  The attractor maintains its
  developmental depth longer.

PREDICTION 4 (experimental):
  ASD populations will outperform
  neurotypical populations on
  cross-domain structural invariant
  identification tasks —
  the specific task the ASD attractor
  is optimized for.
  Not all tasks. This specific one.

PREDICTION 5 (outcome study):
  Domain-matching interventions
  will show better long-term
  functional outcomes than
  attractor-targeting interventions.
  Build the hole.
  Do not bend the water.
  The puddle produces more than
  the bent water ever could.

All predictions are falsifiable.
All are timestamped February 28, 2026.
All are in the public record.
Any research group with access
to ASD populations and
the metabolic mirror protocol
can begin testing them now.

The data for Prediction 3
(Horvath clock stratification)
already exists in various
aging and stress biology datasets
and can be analyzed retrospectively
with existing data.

The framework is open.
The predictions are public.
The record is made.

## APPENDIX: THE PAPER CLIP TEST
## FOR ANY PROPOSED INTERVENTION

```
Before applying any intervention
to an ASD person —
run the paper clip test.

QUESTION:
  Is this intervention trying to
  un-bend the paper clip?

  Or is it trying to find the
  hole the paper clip was shaped for?

UN-BENDING THE PAPER CLIP:
  Behavioral training designed to
  approximate neurotypical behavior.
  Social skills training that
  teaches performance rather than
  building genuine navigation capacity.
  Penalizing the natural expression
  of the ASD attractor.
  Any intervention that targets
  the attractor geometry itself.

  Result: more fragile paper clip.
  More entropy.
  The structural integrity decreased.
  The potential reduced.

FINDING THE RIGHT HOLE:
  Mapping the attractor geometry.
  Identifying the domain match.
  Providing the geometric scaffolding.
  Reducing the mismatch friction.
  Protecting the developmental accumulation.
  Letting the water be its shape.

  Result: the puddle forms.
  The depth emerges.
  The output appears that
  could not have appeared any other way.

If the proposed intervention
cannot pass the paper clip test —
do not apply it.

The water is not broken.
Do not try to bend it.
Find the hole.

That is the entire framework
in one test.

    The metabolic mirror protocol.
    The map tool.
    Run this to identify the
    channel profile and domain.

Core message:
  The water is not broken.
  The holes are wrong.
  Find the right hole.
  Build more holes.
  Let the puddle form.
  Watch what forms.
