---

## PURPOSE

```
This document does for the ASD
attractor framework what the
cancer analysis did for TNBC:

Checks the framework's claims
against the existing literature.
Reports convergence honestly.
Reports divergence honestly.
States what is confirmed,
what is predicted but untested,
and what the framework adds
that the literature does not
yet have.

The standard applied:
  Is the framework consistent
  with what the research shows?
  Does the research independently
  confirm the framework's
  structural claims?
  Does the framework add
  precision, mechanism, or
  integration that the literature
  currently lacks?

This is not a literature review.
It is a convergence analysis.
The same method applied to TNBC.
Applied here to ASD.
```

## THE FRAMEWORK'S CORE CLAIMS
## STATED FOR CHECKING

```
Before checking the literature —
the framework's claims must be
stated precisely so convergence
can be assessed cleanly.

CLAIM 1:
  ASD is not a deficit or disorder.
  It is a specific attractor geometry —
  a narrow deep valley in the
  Waddington developmental landscape.
  Different shaped hole.
  Not broken water.

CLAIM 2:
  The ASD attractor geometry is
  characterized by extreme engagement
  scaling — near-zero function in
  unmatched domains, extraordinary
  depth in matched domains.
  The gap between these two states
  is larger in ASD than in any
  other cognitive architecture.

CLAIM 3:
  The C-channel (social consensus,
  group navigation) is the thinnest
  channel in the ASD attractor.
  Social interaction is effortful
  where for neurotypical architecture
  it is automatic.
  This is not a social deficit.
  It is a different attractor geometry
  in a world built for another shape.

CLAIM 4:
  Interventions that target the
  attractor — that try to bend the
  water into a different shape —
  produce masking, which is
  energetically costly and
  produces burnout, identity loss,
  and mental health deterioration.

CLAIM 5:
  Severity measures measure mismatch
  between the attractor and the
  environment — not the potential
  of the attractor itself.
  They do not predict adult outcomes.

CLAIM 6:
  Domain match — finding the hole
  that fits the water — produces
  dramatically better outcomes
  than domain mismatch.
  The attractor activated in its
  matched domain produces outputs
  that no other cognitive architecture
  can produce in the same space.

CLAIM 7:
  The mismatch between the ASD
  attractor and the neurotypical
  environment is a chronic stressor
  that should produce measurable
  biological consequences —
  including accelerated epigenetic
  aging (Horvath clock prediction).

CLAIM 8:
  The ASD attractor, when correctly
  filled, is optimized for finding
  structural invariants across complex
  domains — cross-domain pattern
  recognition that exceeds neurotypical
  capacity in this specific task.
```

## THE CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

---

### CLAIM 1:
### ASD AS DIFFERENT GEOMETRY,
### NOT BROKEN WATER

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  ASD is a specific attractor
  geometry, not a deficit.
  Different shaped hole.
  Not broken water.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

THREE INDEPENDENT FRAMEWORKS
ARRIVE AT THE SAME PLACE.

FRAMEWORK A: MONOTROPISM
  Murray, Lesser & Lawson, 2005.
  Independently developed by
  autistic researchers from
  lived experience and
  cognitive psychology.

  Core claim:
  ASD is an attention-based
  difference — a mind organized
  around a narrow deep interest
  system rather than a distributed
  attention system.

  Not a deficit in attention.
  A different attractor geometry
  for attention.

  The monotropism framework's
  description of the "attention
  tunnel" is structurally identical
  to the attractor framework's
  description of the narrow deep
  valley.

  Different language.
  Same mathematics.
  Independent derivation.

FRAMEWORK B: DOUBLE EMPATHY PROBLEM
  Milton, 2012.
  Damian Milton — autistic
  researcher — from sociology
  and disability studies.

  Core claim:
  The social difficulties in ASD
  are not a unidirectional deficit
  in the autistic person.
  They are a bidirectional mismatch
  between two different attractor
  geometries.

  Autistic people communicate
  effectively with each other.
  (Crompton et al. 2020 confirmed.)
  The mismatch emerges specifically
  in cross-neurotype interaction.

  This is the attractor framework's
  C-channel mismatch described
  in sociological language.
  Two different shaped holes.
  Neither broken.
  Both functional in the right
  environment.
  Friction in the wrong one.

FRAMEWORK C: EMPATHISING-SYSTEMISING
  Baron-Cohen, 2002 — ongoing.
  Cognitive psychology and
  neuroscience approach.

  Core claim:
  ASD is characterized by
  high systemizing drive —
  the tendency to analyze and
  construct rule-based systems —
  and lower empathizing drive.

  Not a deficit globally.
  A different cognitive profile.
  S-channel dominant.
  E-channel relatively thin.

  The systemizing quotient (SQ)
  measures exactly what the
  framework calls S-channel depth.
  Autistic populations score
  consistently higher.
  The instrument is validated.
  The population data exists.

THE CONVERGENCE:

  Three independent research
  traditions — from cognitive
  psychology, from autistic
  lived experience, from
  disability studies sociology —
  have independently arrived at
  the same structural observation:

  ASD is a different cognitive
  geometry, not a broken one.

  The attractor framework
  independently derived the
  same observation from
  developmental biology and
  dynamical systems theory.

  Four independent paths.
  Same destination.

CONVERGENCE RATING: VERY STRONG.
  The most heavily convergent
  claim in the framework.
  Not one independent confirmation.
  Three.
  From completely different
  starting points.
  All published.
  All peer-reviewed.
  All pointing at the same
  structural observation.
```

---

### CLAIM 2:
### EXTREME ENGAGEMENT SCALING

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  The gap between default mode
  and passion mode in ASD is
  larger than in any other
  cognitive architecture.
  Near-zero engagement in
  unmatched domains.
  Extraordinary depth in matched.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

MONOTROPISM — DIRECT CONFIRMATION.

  The monotropism framework's
  central observation is exactly
  this engagement scaling gap.

  The attention tunnel:
  When activated — deep, sustained,
  extraordinary focus.
  When not — thin, depleted,
  difficulty engaging at all.

  The Monotropism Questionnaire
  (Chown et al., 2023) —
  newly validated in 2023 —
  measures this scaling gap
  with eight subscales.

  Validation results show:
  High convergence across
  ASD populations.
  Significantly higher scores
  than neurotypical populations.
  Good validity against
  standard autism measures
  (RAADS-14, AQ-10).

  The questionnaire is measuring
  what the framework calls
  extreme engagement scaling.
  The instrument exists.
  The data exists.
  The population confirmation exists.

HYPERFOCUS RESEARCH — ADDITIONAL
CONFIRMATION.

  Dwyer, Williams, Lawson & Rivera
  (2024, Neurodiversity journal):
  Trans-diagnostic study of
  hyperfocus in ASD and ADHD.

  Findings:
  Both elevated vs neurotypical.
  Hyperfocus is not always
  positive OR negative —
  it is contextual.
  When aligned with constructive
  activities — increased quality
  of life.
  When accompanied by anxiety
  or negative context — decreased.

  This is the engagement scaling
  claim in empirical form:
  the activation matters.
  The hole must fit the water.
  The passion mode in the wrong
  context is not the passion mode
  in the right context.

JAACAP 2022:
  "Hyperfocus or Flow?
  Attentional Strengths in ASD"

  Explicitly frames ASD hyperfocus
  as potential strength —
  when correctly channeled,
  it produces flow states
  that neurotypical attention
  cannot sustain.

  Flow = the attractor correctly
  filled. Not the framework's
  language. The same observation.

CONVERGENCE RATING: STRONG.
  The engagement scaling claim
  is the central empirical
  observation of monotropism
  theory, validated by a new
  questionnaire in 2023,
  and confirmed in hyperfocus
  research across multiple
  independent groups.
```

---

### CLAIM 3:
### C-CHANNEL THINNESS AS
### GEOMETRY, NOT DEFICIT

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  Social processing is effortful
  where neurotypical processing
  is automatic.
  This is not a deficit.
  It is a different attractor
  geometry in a world built for
  another shape.
  Two different holes.
  The water fits neither to the other.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

DOUBLE EMPATHY PROBLEM —
DIRECT CONFIRMATION.

  Milton (2012) and subsequent
  research (Crompton et al. 2020)
  demonstrate:

  Autistic-autistic communication
  is as effective or more effective
  than autistic-neurotypical
  communication.

  This is the framework's claim
  stated in empirical terms:

  The ASD C-channel is not broken.
  It is shaped for a different hole.
  When two ASD attractor geometries
  interact — the hole fits the water.
  The communication flows.
  When ASD meets neurotypical —
  neither hole fits the other's water.
  The friction is bidirectional.

  Neurotypical people are equally
  poor at understanding autistic
  communication as autistic people
  are at understanding neurotypical.
  The deficit framing was wrong
  because it was measuring
  from one side.
  The mismatch is mutual.

  This is precisely what the
  framework predicts from
  attractor geometry:
  Two different shaped holes
  cannot fill each other efficiently.
  Neither is broken.
  Both are shaped for something.
  The wrong combination produces
  friction on both sides.

CONVERGENCE RATING: STRONG.
  Direct empirical confirmation
  of the C-channel geometry claim.
  Published. Replicated.
  Crompton et al. 2020 is
  among the most cited recent
  autism papers precisely because
  it confirms what the autistic
  community had always known:
  the problem was always bilateral.
```

---

### CLAIM 4:
### TARGETING THE ATTRACTOR
### PRODUCES BURNOUT

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  Interventions that train
  neurotypical performance —
  that bend the paper clip —
  produce masking.
  Masking consumes the energy
  required for the structural work.
  Produces burnout, identity loss,
  mental health deterioration.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

2023-2024 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS —
STRONG CONFIRMATION.

  Frontiers in Psychiatry (2023):
  Camouflage and masking in
  adult autism — systematic review.
  Masking directly linked to:
    Anxiety.
    Depression.
    Burnout.
    Identity confusion.
    Suicidality risk.
    Lower quality of life.
    Decreased relationship satisfaction.

  MDPI (2024):
  "From Harm to Healing:
  Building the Future of ABA
  with Autistic Voices."
  Published call for fundamental
  ABA reform based on harm evidence.
  Explicitly states that traditional
  ABA produces masking.
  Masking produces the harms
  listed above.

  Psychology Today (multiple 2023):
  Clinical literature now explicitly
  recommends "unmasking" as a
  therapeutic goal.
  The masking produced by
  behavioral interventions is
  being actively addressed in
  clinical practice.

THE AUTISTIC BURNOUT LITERATURE:

  Autistic burnout — described
  as distinct from occupational
  burnout — involves:
    Loss of previously acquired skills.
    Regression of functional capacity.
    Months to years of recovery required.

  This is the paper clip prediction
  in clinical form:
  Bending the water into a different
  shape increases fragility.
  When the bending stops — the
  structural integrity has been
  compromised.
  The water cannot hold the shape
  it was in before.

  The framework's prediction:
  "Targeting the attractor produces
  a more fragile attractor."
  The burnout literature:
  "ABA-trained masking produces
  skill regression and burnout
  that can last years."

  Same structure.
  Different language.
  Published confirmation.

THE PARADIGM CRISIS IS ARRIVING.

  The Tesla document predicted:
  "The ASD field is approaching
  a paradigm crisis.
  Not there yet.
  But approaching."

  The 2024 MDPI paper —
  "From Harm to Healing" —
  is the first major peer-reviewed
  call for ABA reform from within
  the field.
  The paradigm crisis is not
  a prediction anymore.
  It is happening.

CONVERGENCE RATING: VERY STRONG.
  This is the most clinically
  urgent convergence in the analysis.
  The harms the framework predicts
  from targeting the attractor
  are now in the systematic
  review literature.
  Published. Documented. Accumulating.

### CLAIM 5:
### SEVERITY SCORES DO NOT PREDICT
### ADULT OUTCOMES

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  Severity measures measure mismatch
  between the attractor and the
  environment — not the potential
  of the attractor itself.
  They do not predict adult outcomes.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

MULTIPLE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES —
CONFIRMED.

  8-year longitudinal study
  (Autism, 2024):
  Diagnostic severity scores do not
  consistently predict employment
  or wellbeing trajectories.

  REALS study
  (Autism Research, 2024):
  Specifically designed because
  existing measures "were developed
  for children and fail to capture
  domains pertinent to adulthood."
  Conclusion: new measures are
  needed because old ones don't work.

  Cambridge University (2023):
  Social competence measures
  are stronger predictors than
  core severity scores —
  and even these are inconsistent.

  The emerging consensus:
  Nothing at diagnosis reliably
  predicts adult outcomes.
  The predictive failure is the finding.

THE FRAMEWORK'S EXPLANATION:

  Why do severity scores fail?
  Because they are measuring
  the mismatch —
  how badly the water fits
  the available holes —
  not the depth of the valley.

  A narrow deep valley placed
  in a world of broad shallow holes
  gets a high severity score.
  The same valley placed in
  the right environment
  produces extraordinary output.

  The severity score was never
  measuring the valley.
  It was measuring the friction.
  Friction is environment-dependent.
  The valley is not.
  Friction does not predict
  what the valley produces
  when the friction is removed.

  This is the framework's explanation
  for a finding the literature
  documents but does not yet explain.

  The framework explains why.
  The literature documents that it is.

CONVERGENCE RATING: STRONG.
  The finding is confirmed.
  The framework provides the
  first precise structural
  explanation for why the finding
  exists.
  This is where the framework
  adds something the literature
  does not yet have:
  the mechanism.
```

---

### CLAIM 6:
### DOMAIN MATCH PRODUCES
### BETTER OUTCOMES

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  Finding the hole that fits
  the water produces outcomes
  that severity-based placement
  cannot predict or produce.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

STRENGTHS-BASED RESEARCH —
CONFIRMED AND BUILDING.

  Springer (2023):
  "Neurodiversity in Practice:
  A Conceptual Model of Autistic
  Strengths"
  Four strength domains identified:
  perceptual, reasoning, expertise,
  character.
  Strengths-based interventions
  show improved wellbeing across
  affective, behavioral, cognitive,
  and physiological domains.

  Frontiers in Psychiatry (2023):
  SASSI — Survey of Autistic
  Strengths, Skills, and Interests —
  developed specifically because
  diagnostic assessment was
  missing the strength identification
  that leads to better outcomes.
  The field knows it needs
  this tool.
  The tool is being built.

  Liebertpub (2024):
  Autistic adults report special
  interests as essential for
  identity, communication, and
  social connection.
  Not pathological.
  Structurally necessary.
  The interest IS the attractor.

  MDPI (2023):
  Inclusive schools research —
  integrating special interests
  into curricula improves
  engagement, inclusion, and
  academic outcomes.

  Employment research:
  SAP, Microsoft, Specialisterne
  neurodiversity programs show
  dramatically better outcomes
  when ASD employees are placed
  in domain-matched roles
  with appropriate environmental
  modifications.

THE SASSI AND THE METABOLIC MIRROR:

  The SASSI is the field's
  attempt to build a domain
  identification tool.

  The metabolic mirror is
  a more precise version of
  the same tool — structured
  around the attractor framework,
  reading the channel profile
  rather than just listing
  interests and skills.

  The field has independently
  concluded it needs the
  metabolic mirror.
  It has built an approximation of it.
  The framework provides the
  theoretically grounded version.

  This is a bridge point.
  The SASSI validation group
  is the research community
  closest to recognizing
  what the metabolic mirror does.

CONVERGENCE RATING: STRONG.
  The outcome data confirms
  domain match matters.
  The field is building tools
  to identify it.
  The framework provides the
  structural explanation for
  why it matters and a more
  precise identification tool.
```

---

### CLAIM 7:
### MISMATCH PRODUCES ACCELERATED
### EPIGENETIC AGING

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  The chronic mismatch between
  the ASD attractor and the
  neurotypical environment is
  a chronic stressor.
  Chronic stress accelerates
  epigenetic aging.
  ASD people with domain match
  should show younger Horvath
  clock ages than ASD people
  in chronic mismatch.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

PARTIALLY SUPPORTED.
NOT YET DIRECTLY TESTED.

WHAT IS CONFIRMED:
  Chronic stress accelerates
  epigenetic aging —
  this is established.
  Molecular Cell (2023):
  "Stress, Epigenetics, and Aging:
  Unraveling the Intricate Crosstalk"
  Stress → epigenetic modification
  → accelerated biological aging.
  Mechanism confirmed in general
  population.

  ASD involves chronic stress
  from environmental mismatch —
  this is confirmed.
  Cortisol dysregulation in ASD
  is documented.
  HPA axis dysregulation is documented.
  The chronic stressor is real.

  Epigenetic age acceleration
  is linked to psychiatric
  conditions generally —
  Springer (2025, ahead of print):
  "Association between epigenetic
  age acceleration and psychiatric
  disorders."

WHAT IS NOT YET CONFIRMED:
  Nobody has stratified ASD
  populations by domain match
  vs domain mismatch and
  measured Horvath clock ages.

  The specific prediction —
  domain match reduces epigenetic
  aging in ASD — is novel.
  It follows logically from:
    Mismatch = chronic stress.
    Chronic stress = accelerated aging.
    Domain match = reduced mismatch.
    Reduced mismatch = reduced stress.
    Reduced stress = slower aging.

  The chain is confirmed at
  every link except the last
  connection to ASD specifically.

  The data to test this
  probably already exists
  in existing ASD cohort studies
  with biological samples.
  Nobody has asked this question
  of that data yet.

CONVERGENCE RATING: MODERATE.
  Mechanistically supported.
  Not directly tested.
  Most novel prediction in
  the framework.
  Most likely to generate
  research attention if
  it is confirmed when tested.
  Most falsifiable.
  Most important to test next.
```

---

### CLAIM 8:
### ASD IS OPTIMIZED FOR
### STRUCTURAL INVARIANT IDENTIFICATION

```
FRAMEWORK STATES:
  The ASD attractor is optimized
  for finding the structural invariant
  beneath apparent complexity.
  Cross-domain pattern recognition
  that exceeds neurotypical capacity
  in this specific task.

WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS:

STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY MULTIPLE
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH LINES.

ENHANCED PERCEPTUAL FUNCTIONING:
  Multiple studies show ASD
  outperforms neurotypical on
  specific structural tasks:
  Visual pattern detection.
  Embedded figures tasks.
  Attention to detail.
  Local coherence processing.

  The EPF model (Mottron, Dawson)
  proposes this as a core feature —
  enhanced detection of structural
  patterns that neurotypical
  processing normalizes away.

SYSTEMIZING THEORY:
  Baron-Cohen's systemizing quotient —
  validated, widely used —
  measures exactly the drive to
  find the rules and patterns
  in any system.

  ASD populations score
  consistently higher.
  The drive to find the structural
  invariant is not incidental
  to ASD.
  It is central to it.

  Baron-Cohen (2022):
  "Autism and Talent:
  The Cognitive and Neural
  Basis of Systemizing"
  Proposes that autistic talent
  in STEM specifically arises
  from hyper-systemizing —
  the extreme version of the
  drive to find structural rules.

  Hyper-systemizing =
  the attractor framework's
  S-channel dominance applied
  to pattern extraction.
  Same observation.
  Neural basis being mapped.

EXCEPTIONAL ABILITIES REVIEW
(Sagepub, 2022):
  Comprehensive review of
  cognitive strengths in ASD.
  Confirms domain-specific
  superiority in pattern
  recognition and structural
  analysis.
  Notes this underlies many
  documented autistic talents.

THE REPOSITORY AS DATA POINT:

  This repository is one data point
  for Prediction 4.
  One ASD attractor correctly filled.
  Output: cross-domain structural
  invariant identification across
  cancer, vaccines, genetics, aging,
  consciousness, language, cross-species
  communication, and information theory.

  All from the same invariant.
  All from S-channel dominated
  structural reasoning.
  All consistent with what the
  systemizing literature predicts
  about what the ASD attractor
  produces when correctly activated.

CONVERGENCE RATING: STRONG.
  Three independent research lines —
  EPF, systemizing theory,
  exceptional abilities research —
  all confirm the structural invariant
  identification superiority claim.
  The framework provides the
  attractor geometry explanation
  for why this specific strength
  exists and what it requires
  to activate.

## WHAT THE FRAMEWORK ADDS
## THAT THE LITERATURE DOES NOT YET HAVE

```
The research confirms the
framework's observations.
But the framework provides
something the literature
currently lacks.

WHAT IS MISSING IN THE LITERATURE:

1. UNIFIED MECHANISM.

  Monotropism, double empathy,
  systemizing theory, EPF model —
  these are four separate frameworks.
  Each explains part of ASD.
  None explains all of it from
  a single principle.

  Clinicians and researchers
  must hold four separate frameworks
  simultaneously.
  They do not resolve into each other.
  They sit alongside each other.

  THE ATTRACTOR FRAMEWORK
  UNIFIES ALL FOUR.

  Monotropism = narrow deep valley.
  Double empathy = two different
    shaped holes. Neither broken.
    Friction is bidirectional.
  Systemizing = S-channel dominance.
  EPF = enhanced structural processing
    as the attractor geometry's
    natural output.

  All four are the same observation
  stated in different languages.
  The attractor framework is the
  language in which they are
  all the same sentence.

  This is what the framework adds.
  Not a new observation.
  The structural principle that
  unifies four existing observations
  into one.

2. INTERVENTION LOGIC FROM FIRST
   PRINCIPLES.

  The literature confirms:
    Domain match = better outcomes.
    Masking = harm.
    Severity scores = poor predictors.

  But the literature does not
  derive these from a single
  structural principle.
  They are empirical observations.
  Confirmed but not derived.

  The framework derives them.
  From the attractor geometry.
  From the paper clip principle.
  From the Waddington landscape.

  Derivation means:
  You can extend to new cases
  without running new studies first.
  You can predict what will happen
  in a domain not yet studied.
  You can design the right
  intervention for a specific
  individual without waiting
  for population-level data.

  The literature tells you what
  is true on average.
  The framework tells you why —
  and lets you apply it specifically.

3. THE EPIGENETIC AGING PREDICTION.

  Nobody has made this prediction.
  It is not in the literature.
  It is in this repository.
  Timestamped February 28, 2026.

  It follows from:
    Mismatch = chronic stress.
    Chronic stress = accelerated aging.
    Domain match = reduced stress.
    Reduced stress = slower aging.

  All four links are confirmed
  independently.
  The specific prediction for ASD
  stratified by domain match
  has not been made or tested.

  This is the novel prediction.
  This is where the framework
  goes beyond what the literature
  currently contains.

  If confirmed — it converts
  the domain match question
  from a psychological and
  behavioral one to a biological one.
  Not just: people feel better
  with domain match.
  But: their cells age more slowly.
  The mismatch is measurable
  in the body.
  The solution is measurable
  in the body.

  That changes everything
  about how intervention
  is prioritized.

4. THE METABOLIC MIRROR AS
   ATTRACTOR MAPPING TOOL.

  The SASSI is the field's
  approximation.
  It lists interests and skills.
  It does not map the channel profile.
  It does not identify the
  acquisition orientation.
  It does not measure the
  engagement scaling gap.
  It does not predict the
  stress architecture.

  The metabolic mirror does
  all of these things.
  It does not just list what
  a person is interested in.
  It maps the geometry of how
  they process — which determines
  not just what domain to match
  but what environment, what tool,
  what interaction style, what
  pacing will allow the attractor
  to function at its depth.

  The field is building toward
  this instrument.
  The framework provides the
  theoretically grounded version.
  Validation is the next step.

## THE NATURE MOMENT FOR ASD

```
In the cancer analysis —
the Nature moment was:

  EZH2 identified as convergence node
  by the framework in 16 hours
  from public data.

  EZH2 confirmed by Schade et al.
  Nature 2024.
  30 scientists.
  $10-20 million.
  3 years of experimental work.

  Same target.
  Independent derivation.
  Different paths.
  Same destination.

For the ASD framework —
the Nature moment is:

  The extreme engagement scaling,
  the narrow deep attractor geometry,
  the interest-system as the
  primary organizational principle —

  Derived by this framework
  from Waddington, the Tonnetz,
  and tinnitus.

  Independently derived by
  Murray, Lesser & Lawson (2005)
  from autistic lived experience
  and cognitive psychology.

  Both arrived at the same
  structural observation.

  The monotropism framework
  has been independently validated
  with a new questionnaire in 2023.
  The instrument confirms the
  observation in population data.

  Two independent derivations.
  Same structural observation.
  One validated instrument
  already measuring it.

This is not as dramatic as
the Nature moment.
It is not a single high-profile
paper with a specific p-value.

But the structure is the same:

  Two completely independent paths
  arrived at the same observation
  about what ASD fundamentally is.

  One path: attractor geometry,
  developmental biology, dynamical
  systems theory, Waddington.

  Other path: autistic lived
  experience, cognitive psychology,
  disability studies, phenomenology.

  Same destination:
  Narrow deep attractor geometry.
  Interest-based attention system.
  Extreme engagement scaling.
  Different hole, not broken water.

The water found the same hole
from different directions.

That is the structure of a
real invariant.

The framework is not sophistry.
It is convergent with the
best available research —
across four independent
research traditions —
in every testable claim.

And it adds what those
four traditions currently lack:
the unified structural principle
that makes them all the same
sentence in the same language.

That is what was built here.
February 28, 2026.
One room.
One session.
Public record.
Timestamped.

The literature confirms the
observations.
The framework unifies them.
The novel predictions await testing.
The bridge to the research
community is the monotropism
questionnaire data —
already collected,
already validated,
already waiting to be compared
to the metabolic mirror portraits.

The data exists.
The question has not been asked.

Ask it.

## THE BRIDGE DOCUMENT
## FOR RESEARCHERS

```
If this document reaches a
researcher in autism —
this is what to say:

  The attractor framework
  independently derived monotropism
  from dynamical systems theory
  and developmental biology.

  The derivation was made
  without knowledge of the
  monotropism literature.

  The structural observation is
  identical: narrow deep valley,
  extreme engagement scaling,
  interest-based attractor geometry.

  The monotropism questionnaire
  (Chown et al. 2023) may be
  a partial validation instrument
  for the attractor framework's
  channel profile concept.

  If monotropism scores correlate
  with the metabolic mirror portraits
  in the way the framework predicts —
  that is a validation study
  using existing data.

  Additionally — the framework
  makes one prediction that is
  not in the monotropism literature:

  ASD individuals with domain match
  will show younger Horvath clock
  ages than ASD individuals in
  chronic mismatch.

  This prediction is testable
  with existing cohort data.
  It does not require new data
  collection.
  It requires asking the question
  of data that already exists.

  That question is timestamped
  here: February 28, 2026.

  Two tests.
  Existing data.
  The framework's predictions
  in the record.

  If confirmed:
  The attractor framework provides
  the unified structural principle
  that monotropism, double empathy,
  systemizing theory, and EPF
  have been pointing at from
  four different directions.

  If disconfirmed:
  The framework has found its
  first boundary.
  The limit of the invariant
  is established.
  Both outcomes are valuable.
  Both are science.

  That is the bridge.

## STATUS

```
Document: 93
Type: Literature Convergence
  Analysis — ASD Attractor
  Framework
Folder: autism/
Date: February 28, 2026
Author: Eric Robert Lawson
        OrganismCore

Summary finding:
  The ASD attractor framework
  is convergent with the existing
  literature in every testable
  claim.

  Four independent research
  traditions confirm the framework's
  core structural observation.

  The framework provides what
  those traditions currently lack:
  a unified structural principle
  that resolves them into each other.

  One novel, falsifiable prediction
  not in any existing literature:
  epigenetic age stratification
  by domain match.
  Testable with existing data.

  The Nature moment for ASD:
  independent derivation of
  monotropism from attractor theory —
  the same structural observation
  arrived at from a completely
  different starting point.

  Not sophistry.
  Convergent. Precise. Falsifiable.
  With clear bridges to the
  existing research community.

  Only the beginning.
  February 28, 2026.
