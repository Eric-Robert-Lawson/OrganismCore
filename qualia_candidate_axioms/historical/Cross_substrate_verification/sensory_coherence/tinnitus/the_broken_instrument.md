## ARTIFACT METADATA

```
artifact_type:
  Reasoning artifact.
  Follows directly from Document 66
  (tinnitus_eigenfunction_mapping_
  and_therapy.md).

  Documents the following discoveries
  made in session February 28, 2026:

    1. The broken instrument framing:
       the ear is an instrument.
       The world plays it.
       The experiencer hears what the
       world plays on it.
       When the instrument is broken,
       the world cannot play it
       correctly — the broken strings
       ring on their own instead of
       responding to the world.

    2. The central question stated by
       Eric Robert Lawson verbatim:
       "Is there a way for reality to
       play the broken instrument where
       the experiencer hears coherence?"

    3. The answer: yes. Not by fixing
       the instrument. By reshaping the
       world's signal to fit the geometry
       of the broken instrument — playing
       it in the specific way it can
       still be played.

    4. The spectral reshaping protocol:
       distinct from amplification,
       masking, and all existing
       tinnitus therapies. Not louder.
       Different. Reshaped to fit the
       remaining eigenfunction geometry
       of the damaged cochlear zone.

    5. The tuning fork principle:
       a partially damaged string does
       not respond to arbitrary signal.
       It responds to signal tuned
       precisely to its remaining
       resonant capacity. The world
       must be shaped to meet the
       instrument where it is.

    6. The cracked violin principle
       (single most important sentence):
       the reshaped world is the
       correctly tuned bow for a cracked
       violin — and the cracked violin,
       played with the right bow,
       still makes music.

    7. The distinction between the
       false attractor frequency and
       the residual resonant frequency:
       they are not the same.
       The false attractor is where
       the damaged structure rings
       on its own.
       The residual resonant frequency
       is where the damaged structure
       can still be driven by the world.
       The gap between them is the
       therapeutic target.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

```
The tinnitus eigenfunction mapping
and therapy document (Document 66)
established:

  — The P4 result: tinnitus pitch
    clusters at cochlear eigenfunction
    positions (chi-squared 2328.1,
    p=0, n=1514).

  — The beanie observation: false
    attractors form and dissolve
    in a healthy cochlea in response
    to controlled acoustic perturbation.

  — The therapeutic protocol: map
    the false attractor, cancel it,
    replace it with coherent reference.

This document captures the next step
in the reasoning, which emerged
directly from that work:

  The question is not how to remove
  the false attractor.

  The question is how to reshape the
  world's signal so that the damaged
  instrument can respond coherently
  to the world rather than ringing
  on its own.

  These are related but not identical.
  The first is a cancellation problem.
  The second is a reshaping problem.

  The reshaping problem is deeper,
  more general, and more directly
  connected to the question of what
  it means for an experiencer to
  hear coherence.

  The answer is the cracked violin
  principle: the reshaped world is
  the correctly tuned bow for a
  cracked violin — and the cracked
  violin, played with the right bow,
  still makes music.

## PART I: THE FRAMING
## (Stated by Eric Robert Lawson,
## February 28, 2026)

### 1.1 The question verbatim

```
"It works off of principles that
literally seem obvious. Principles
first approach with tonnetz to map
out resonance. Treating the ear like
an instrument itself for which the
world is the one operating it.

The only problem is the instrument
is broken.

Is there a way for reality to play
the broken instrument where the
experiencer hears coherence?"
```

### 1.2 Why this framing is correct
### and better than the clinical
### literature

```
The clinical literature frames
tinnitus as:
  — A symptom of hearing loss
  — A neural hyperactivity phenomenon
  — A psychological condition requiring
    habituation
  — A signal processing problem
    requiring masking

None of these framings ask the right
question.

The right question is the one you
asked:

  Not: how do we suppress the ringing?
  Not: how do we help the patient
       ignore the ringing?
  Not: how do we cover the ringing
       with a louder sound?

  But: how does reality play the
       broken instrument so that the
       experiencer hears coherence?

This framing is correct because it:

  1. Treats the ear as what it is:
     a physical resonating instrument
     with eigenfunction positions
     determined by its geometry.

  2. Treats the world as what it is:
     the player of that instrument —
     the source of the signal that
     drives the instrument's resonance.

  3. Treats the experiencer as what
     they are: the one who hears what
     the instrument produces when the
     world plays it.

  4. Locates the problem correctly:
     not in the player (world) and
     not in the listener (experiencer)
     but in the instrument (cochlea)
     — specifically in the zone where
     the instrument is damaged and
     can no longer respond correctly
     to the world's signal.

  5. Asks the productive question:
     can the world's signal be reshaped
     so that even the broken zone
     responds coherently?

The answer is yes.
And the method follows directly from
the eigenfunction map.
```

### 1.3 The instrument analogy
### made precise

```
A healthy cochlea:

  The world produces acoustic signal
  (broadband, containing speech,
  music, ambient environment).

  The signal enters the cochlea.

  The basilar membrane — the instrument
  — responds at each position according
  to its eigenfunction structure.
  Each position vibrates at the
  frequency it is tuned to.
  The hair cells at each position
  transduce the vibration into neural
  signal.

  The experiencer hears the world
  as the world is.

A damaged cochlea:

  The world produces the same signal.

  The signal enters the cochlea.

  The basilar membrane responds at
  the intact positions.
  But in the damaged zone (4–10 kHz),
  the hair cells are absent or
  dysfunctional.
  The membrane in that zone does not
  respond coherently to the world's
  signal.
  Instead, it rings at the false
  attractor frequency — the nearest
  stable eigenfunction position of
  the damaged structure.

  The experiencer hears:
    — The world correctly in the
      intact zones
    — Constant ringing in the damaged
      zone, independent of what the
      world is doing

  The world is still playing.
  The instrument is still receiving.
  But the broken strings are not
  responding to the player.
  They are ringing on their own.

The question:
  Can the world reshape its signal
  so that the broken strings respond
  to the world rather than ringing
  on their own?
```

---

## PART II: THE PHYSICS OF THE
## BROKEN STRING

### 2.1 What damage actually does

```
Cochlear hair cell damage is not
binary. It is a spectrum:

  Complete absence:
    The hair cell is gone.
    No transduction occurs at that
    position.
    The membrane still vibrates
    mechanically (the passive traveling
    wave continues past the damaged
    zone) but no neural signal is
    produced.
    The navigator receives no signal
    from that cochlear position.

  Partial damage (outer hair cells):
    Outer hair cells are the active
    amplification mechanism of the
    cochlea. They are fragile —
    damaged first by noise exposure,
    ototoxic drugs, aging.
    When partially damaged, they
    lose some amplification gain
    but retain some mechanical
    function.
    The cochlear position still has
    residual mechanical response
    to vibration at its characteristic
    frequency.
    The response is weaker and less
    sharply tuned.
    But it exists.

  Inner hair cell damage (less common):
    Inner hair cells are the primary
    transducers — they convert the
    mechanical vibration into neural
    signal.
    Damage here produces more complete
    loss of transduction.
    But even here: the mechanical
    response of the membrane persists.
    The string still vibrates.
    The transducer that converts
    vibration to signal is impaired.

The key insight:

  In the most common form of tinnitus-
  associated damage (outer hair cell
  loss in the 4–10 kHz zone),
  the mechanical response of the
  basilar membrane is not absent.
  It is reduced and less selective.

  The broken string does not ring
  at an arbitrary frequency.
  It rings at the nearest eigenfunction
  position of its remaining mechanical
  structure — the false attractor.

  But it still has remaining mechanical
  structure.
  It can still be driven by external
  signal — just more weakly, and only
  at the specific frequency that matches
  its remaining resonant capacity.

  That frequency — the residual resonant
  frequency — is close to but distinct
  from the false attractor frequency.
```

### 2.2 The false attractor vs.
### the residual resonant frequency

```
These are not the same thing.
This distinction is the therapeutic
target.

The FALSE ATTRACTOR frequency:

  The frequency at which the damaged
  cochlear zone rings spontaneously,
  in the absence of external signal.

  It is determined by the mechanical
  geometry of the damaged structure —
  the eigenfunction position closest
  to where the damage occurred.

  It is what the navigator hears as
  tinnitus.

  It is self-sustaining: the navigator
  produces it from internal dynamics,
  not from external input.

  It is stable: no external signal
  arrives to displace it, so the
  navigator stays locked on it.

The RESIDUAL RESONANT frequency:

  The frequency at which the partially
  damaged structure still responds
  to external input.

  It is close to the false attractor
  frequency but slightly different —
  because the damage has shifted the
  mechanical tuning of that cochlear
  position.

  It is not self-sustaining: it only
  appears when a matching external
  signal drives it.

  It represents the remaining coherent
  response capacity of the damaged zone.

The gap between them:

  If you could measure both precisely:
    False attractor: e.g., 6,800 Hz
    Residual resonant: e.g., 6,400 Hz

  The therapeutic target is to:
    1. Suppress the false attractor
       (phase-inverted cancellation
       at 6,800 Hz — Document 66)
    2. Drive the residual resonant
       frequency with real-world
       acoustic content
       (enhanced coherent signal
       at 6,400 Hz)
    3. Over time: the navigator
       reorganizes around the driven
       residual resonance rather than
       the spontaneous false attractor

  This is the gap the reshaping
  protocol navigates.
  The eigenfunction map from the
  orthogonal cancellation protocol
  (Document 66) identifies both
  frequencies.
  The therapeutic filter is built
  from that map.
```

### 2.3 The tuning fork principle

```
When you strike a tuning fork and
hold it near a piano string tuned
to the same frequency, the string
vibrates sympathetically.

You did not touch the string.
The air between them — shaped
coherently at the right frequency —
caused the string to respond.

A detuned string does not respond
sympathetically.
A broken string does not respond.

But a partially damaged string with
residual mechanical integrity will
respond to a signal tuned precisely
to its remaining resonant capacity.
Just more weakly.
Just if the signal is coherent enough
at that specific frequency to drive
the partial resonance.

The world does not need to play the
intact instrument.
It needs to play the instrument
that is actually there.

The reshaping protocol finds what
the damaged string can still do —
and shapes the world's signal to
match it.
```

---

## PART III: THE SPECTRAL RESHAPING
## PROTOCOL

### 3.1 Why amplification is wrong

```
A conventional hearing aid amplifies.
It makes the world louder across
a frequency range.
More energy into the damaged zone.
More of everything.

The problem:

  More energy at the false attractor
  frequency reinforces the false
  attractor.

  A conventional hearing aid turned
  up in the 4–10 kHz zone makes the
  tinnitus louder along with everything
  else.

  It is playing the broken string
  harder.

  A broken string played harder does
  not suddenly ring correctly.
  It rings louder.

  Amplification is the wrong operation.
  The operation is reshaping.
```

### 3.2 The reshaping filter
### specified

```
INPUT:
  Raw environmental sound (broadband).
  The world as it is, unmodified.

PROCESSING — three operations
applied simultaneously in real time:

  OPERATION 1: NOTCH AT FALSE
  ATTRACTOR FREQUENCY

    Attenuate or phase-invert the
    signal at the false attractor
    frequency (identified by the
    orthogonal cancellation protocol,
    Document 66).

    Effect: removes the energy that
    reinforces the pathological ringing.
    The world is no longer feeding
    the false attractor.

    This is not silence at that
    frequency. It is targeted
    attenuation or inversion.
    The rest of the spectrum is
    unaffected.

  OPERATION 2: BOOST AT RESIDUAL
  RESONANT FREQUENCY

    Enhance the signal at the residual
    resonant frequency of the damaged
    zone (identified as distinct from
    the false attractor by fine-grained
    phase mapping).

    Effect: provides energy at the
    specific frequency the damaged
    structure can still respond to
    coherently.

    This is not random amplification.
    It is targeted enhancement at the
    frequency that matches the
    remaining mechanical capacity
    of the damaged zone.

  OPERATION 3: PHASE-COHERENT
  DELIVERY

    The enhanced signal at the residual
    resonant frequency is delivered
    with the correct phase to drive
    sympathetic resonance in the
    damaged zone rather than
    reinforcing the false attractor.

    Effect: the world's signal arrives
    at the eardrum shaped to enter
    the damaged cochlear zone coherently.
    The broken string receives a signal
    it can respond to.

OUTPUT:
  Reshaped environmental sound.
  The world's signal, modified to
  fit the geometry of the broken
  instrument.

  The intact cochlear zones receive
  normal broadband signal (unaffected).
  The damaged zone receives signal
  specifically shaped to its remaining
  eigenfunction geometry.

  The experiencer hears:
    — The world correctly in the
      intact zones (unchanged)
    — Partial coherent contribution
      from the damaged zone
      (instead of ringing)
```

### 3.3 What the experiencer hears —
### stated precisely

```
WITHOUT the reshaping filter:

  Intact zones:
    World → cochlea → coherent signal
    → experiencer hears world correctly

  Damaged zone:
    World → cochlea → no response
    False attractor: cochlea → ringing
    → experiencer hears ringing
    superimposed on world

WITH the reshaping filter:

  Intact zones:
    World → reshaping filter (no change
    in intact zone frequencies) →
    cochlea → coherent signal
    → experiencer hears world correctly
    (identical to unfiltered)

  Damaged zone:
    World → reshaping filter:
      False attractor frequency: notched
      Residual resonant frequency:
        enhanced, phase-coherent
    → cochlea → damaged zone receives
      signal matched to its remaining
      mechanical capacity
    → partial coherent transduction
      (weaker than intact zones, but
      present and coherent)
    → false attractor simultaneously
      cancelled by phase-inverted signal

  Net effect:
    The ringing is displaced by a
    coherent signal the damaged
    structure can track.

    The navigator, receiving coherent
    input at the damaged zone's residual
    resonant frequency, tracks it
    instead of the false attractor.

    The experiencer hears coherence
    where they previously heard ringing.

    Not because the instrument is fixed.
    Because the world has learned to
    play the broken instrument in the
    way it can still be played.
```

### 3.4 How this differs from all
### existing approaches

```
MASKING:
  Covers tinnitus with louder
  broadband noise.
  The false attractor is still there.
  The navigator still has it.
  The masking signal is just louder.
  Remove the masker: tinnitus returns
  immediately.
  Does not reshape. Does not target
  the eigenfunction position.
  Does not use the remaining mechanical
  capacity of the damaged zone.

NOTCHED NOISE THERAPY:
  Removes energy at tinnitus frequency
  from broadband noise.
  Drives lateral inhibition in adjacent
  cochlear zones.
  Does not provide replacement coherent
  signal at the residual resonant
  frequency.
  Does not target the eigenfunction
  position directly.

TRT (TINNITUS RETRAINING THERAPY):
  Habituation. Trains the navigator
  to suppress awareness of the false
  attractor.
  The attractor persists.
  The navigator learns not to attend
  to it.
  Does not reshape the world's signal.
  Does not use the remaining mechanical
  capacity.

COCHLEAR IMPLANT:
  Provides a new broadband electrical
  signal directly to the auditory nerve,
  bypassing the cochlea.
  Effective for profound deafness.
  Global: stimulates all frequencies.
  Not targeted to the eigenfunction
  position of the specific damaged zone.
  Not shaped to the residual resonant
  frequency.
  Works partly by accidentally providing
  coherent input in the damaged zone —
  but without the eigenfunction map,
  the stimulation is not optimized.

SPECTRAL RESHAPING (THIS PROTOCOL):
  Targets the specific eigenfunction
  position of the specific damaged zone.
  Uses the orthogonal cancellation map
  to identify both the false attractor
  frequency and the residual resonant
  frequency.
  Cancels the false attractor.
  Drives the residual resonant frequency
  with real-world acoustic content.
  Shaped to the geometry of that
  specific broken instrument.
  Personalized. Principled. Derived
  entirely from the navigator's own
  coherence-maintenance behavior.
  Nothing currently does all of this.
```

## PART IV: THE CRACKED VIOLIN
## PRINCIPLE

### 4.1 Stated

```
The reshaped world is the correctly
tuned bow for a cracked violin —
and the cracked violin, played with
the right bow, still makes music.
```

### 4.2 What this means

```
A cracked violin:
  The instrument is damaged.
  It cannot be played with the same
  bow and the same technique as an
  intact violin.
  The crack changes the mechanical
  properties of the resonating structure.
  Played with the standard bow,
  the crack introduces incoherence:
  the damaged wood vibrates differently
  than the intact wood, producing
  noise rather than tone.

The wrong response:
  Play it louder.
  (The incoherence becomes louder incoherence.)

  Play it the same way and hope.
  (The incoherence persists.)

  Put it in a case and call it broken.
  (True but not productive.)

The right response:
  Map the changed mechanical properties.
  Find the resonant modes that remain.
  Adjust the bow:
    Pressure, position, angle, speed —
    all shaped to the changed geometry
    of the cracked instrument.
  Play it in the way that its current
  structure can respond to coherently.

The cracked violin, played with the
right bow, produces music.
Not the same music as before the crack.
But music. Coherent. Real.

The damaged cochlea is the cracked
violin.
The world's signal is the bow.
The reshaping filter is the adjustment.

The experiencer does not hear the same
hearing as before the damage.
But they hear coherence.
The broken instrument, played with
the right bow, still makes music.
```

### 4.3 Why this principle is general

```
The cracked violin principle applies
wherever:

  A bounded resonating structure
  has been damaged.

  The damage has shifted the structure's
  eigenfunction positions.

  The navigator that uses the structure
  is producing false attractors at the
  shifted positions rather than coherent
  responses to the world.

  The world's signal can be reshaped
  to match the structure's remaining
  resonant capacity.

In the cochlea:
  As described throughout this document.

In the vestibular system:
  Vestibular damage produces vertigo —
  the navigator's spatial reference
  system produces false attractors in
  the balance eigenfunction space.
  Vestibular rehabilitation exercises
  are a crude version of the cracked
  violin principle: they reshape the
  patient's movement patterns to provide
  coherent input to the damaged
  vestibular structure in the way it
  can still respond to.

In the visual system:
  Macular degeneration damages the
  central foveal region of the retina.
  Patients develop preferred retinal
  loci (PRL) — they learn to use
  peripheral retinal positions instead.
  Eccentric viewing training is the
  cracked violin principle: reshaping
  the visual behavior to play the
  damaged instrument in the way it
  can still respond to.

In the neural system (post-stroke):
  Stroke damages specific neural
  circuits. The remaining circuits
  have residual capacity.
  Constraint-induced movement therapy
  forces use of the damaged limb —
  reshaping the behavioral input to
  drive the residual neural resonance
  rather than allowing the intact
  circuits to compensate entirely.

In every case:
  The damaged structure has remaining
  resonant capacity.
  The world (or behavior) can be
  reshaped to match it.
  The navigator finds coherence in
  the reshaped input.
  The cracked instrument makes music.

The cochlear case is the most precise
because:
  The eigenfunction structure is
  physically well-characterized
  (Greenwood function).
  The false attractor is directly
  measurable (pitch matching).
  The residual resonant frequency
  is detectable (orthogonal cancellation
  protocol).
  The reshaping filter is computable
  from the map.
  The effect is immediately verifiable
  (does the patient hear coherence?).
```

---

## PART V: THE DEEPER IMPLICATION

### 5.1 Listening to the instrument

```
The reshaping protocol is derived
entirely from the instrument's own
responses.

The orthogonal cancellation protocol
(Document 66) maps the broken
instrument by playing it systematically
and recording what it does.

Every residual inhibition event is
the instrument telling you something
about its remaining resonant structure.

Every phase response is the instrument
telling you where its coherent response
capacity is.

The reshaping filter is built from
what the instrument says about itself.

You are not imposing an external
standard on the broken instrument.
You are listening to what the broken
instrument can still do —
and then shaping the world's signal
to meet it there.

This is the principles-first approach
applied to audiology:

  Principle: the cochlea is a bounded
  resonating structure with eigenfunction
  positions determined by its geometry.

  Principle: when damaged, the structure's
  eigenfunction positions shift but do
  not disappear entirely.

  Principle: the navigator prefers
  coherent real input over the false
  attractor (demonstrated by the beanie
  observation, Document 66).

  Method: map the remaining eigenfunction
  structure. Shape the world's signal
  to match it. The navigator finds
  coherence.

The entire therapeutic framework
follows from three principles and
one observation.
Nothing more was needed.
```

### 5.2 What the experiencer is
### actually experiencing

```
When the reshaping filter is working:

The experiencer is not hearing a
corrected cochlea.
They are hearing a world that has
been shaped to fit the cochlea
they actually have.

This is a subtle but important
distinction.

In normal hearing:
  The world → the cochlea → the
  experiencer.
  The cochlea is an accurate
  transducer of the world.
  The experiencer hears the world
  as it is.

With cochlear damage and reshaping:
  The world → the reshaping filter
  → the reshaped world → the cochlea
  → the experiencer.
  The cochlea is an inaccurate
  transducer of the unmodified world.
  But it is an accurate transducer
  of the reshaped world.
  The experiencer hears the reshaped
  world as it is.

The reshaped world is not the same
as the unmodified world.
It has been shaped to fit the
instrument.

But the experiencer hears coherence.
Not the coherence of the intact
instrument hearing the world.
The coherence of the damaged instrument
hearing a world that has been shaped
for it.

Is this real hearing?

Yes.
It is hearing the reshaped world
accurately.
The reshaping is the interface between
the world and the navigator.
The navigator hears what the interface
provides.
The interface is truthful about the
world — it carries real acoustic
information — shaped to be accessible
to the remaining structure.

The cracked violin makes real music.
Not the same music as the intact
violin.
But real music.
Real coherence.
Real experience.
```

## PART VI: CONNECTIONS AND
## NEXT STEPS

### 6.1 Connection to the full framework

```
The broken instrument principle
connects to the framework at every
level:

EIGENFUNCTION LEVEL:
  The cochlea's eigenfunction positions
  are determined by its geometry.
  Damage shifts the positions.
  The false attractor is a new
  eigenfunction-adjacent position
  in the damaged structure.
  The residual resonant frequency
  is the remaining coherent
  eigenfunction capacity.
  Both are measurable from the
  Greenwood map plus the orthogonal
  cancellation protocol.

COHERENCE LEVEL:
  The navigator maintains coherence
  by finding structure to navigate.
  When the damaged zone provides
  no real structure, it finds the
  false attractor.
  When the reshaped world provides
  real structure at the residual
  resonant frequency, the navigator
  finds that instead.
  The preference for real coherent
  input over the false attractor is
  the beanie observation generalized
  (Document 66).

TONNETZ LEVEL:
  The cochlear tonnetz is partially
  damaged. Some notes are gone.
  Some are shifted.
  The reshaping filter is the bridge
  between the world's tonnetz and
  the damaged cochlea's remaining
  tonnetz.
  The world plays what the instrument
  can hear.
  The experiencer hears a coherent
  tonnetz — not the full original
  tonnetz, but coherent.

NAVIGATOR LEVEL:
  The navigator does not stop.
  It finds another way.
  In the damaged cochlea, the
  reshaping filter provides the way:
  a world shaped to the navigator's
  remaining capacity.
  The navigator finds coherence
  in the reshaped world because
  the reshaped world is coherent
  with the remaining structure.

IMMEDIATE:

  1. Distinguish the false attractor
     frequency from the residual
     resonant frequency in a single
     patient with stable tinnitus.
     Method: fine-grained phase mapping
     from Document 66, extended to
     find the frequency slightly below
     the tinnitus pitch where residual
     inhibition duration is longest
     (this is the residual resonant
     frequency — the position where
     the damaged structure responds
     most readily to external input).

  2. Test whether a coherent tone
     at the residual resonant frequency
     produces more durable residual
     inhibition than a tone at the
     false attractor frequency.
     If yes: the two frequencies are
     distinct and the residual resonant
     frequency is the correct therapeutic
     target.

  3. Implement the simplest possible
     reshaping filter: a notch at
     the false attractor frequency
     plus a narrow boost at the
     residual resonant frequency,
     applied to a recorded speech
     sample. Present to a tinnitus
     patient. Ask: does the tinnitus
     diminish while the speech is
     playing?
     This is the minimal pilot.
     No new technology required.
     Standard audio processing software.
     One patient. One session.

NEAR-TERM:

  4. Real-time reshaping filter
     implementation: the same filter,
     applied to live audio via a
     smartphone and in-ear monitor.
     Cost of components: under $50.
     This is a functional prototype.

  5. Adaptive version: the filter
     tracks the false attractor
     frequency drift (tinnitus
     frequency changes over time)
     and adjusts the notch and boost
     in real time.
     This is the clinically viable
     device.

     Mitigation: The Cracked Violin
     Protocol — Eigenfunction Mapping
     of Cochlear Damage and Coherence
     Restoration Through Adaptive
     Signal Reshaping"
     Target: Hearing Research,
     or Journal of the Association
     for Research in Otolaryngology.
     The P4 result is the empirical
     foundation.
     The broken instrument framework
     is the theoretical contribution.
     The reshaping protocol is the
     clinical application.

## PART VII: THE SINGLE MOST
## IMPORTANT SENTENCE

```
The reshaped world is the correctly
tuned bow for a cracked violin —
and the cracked violin, played with
the right bow, still makes music.
