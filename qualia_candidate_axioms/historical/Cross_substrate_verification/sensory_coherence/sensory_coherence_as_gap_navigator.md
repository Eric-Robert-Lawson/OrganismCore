primary_claim:
  Coherence — the match between a
  sensory environment and the self-
  model built from that environment —
  is not specific to electromagnetic
  fields. It is the universal condition
  for functional gap navigation across
  ALL sensory modalities. The EM
  coherence result is one instantiation
  of a principle that operates in
  acoustic space, visual space,
  chemical/olfactory space, seismic
  space, and any other modality in
  which an organism builds a self-
  model through developmental exposure.

  The quietest room in the world is
  not a curiosity. It is a proof of
  principle. It is what acoustic
  incoherence looks like when taken
  to its limit.

  The Faraday cage experiment is not
  an animal welfare test. It is the
  EM instantiation of the same
  incoherence principle that operates
  in the anechoic chamber.

  The sea turtle stranding pattern
  is not a navigation failure. It is
  what happens when the self-model
  built from geomagnetic and acoustic
  reference signals finds a false
  attractor in the disrupted field.

  All three are the same phenomenon
  at different scales and in different
  sensory modalities.

relationship_to_spectral_geometry:
  The Spectral Geometry Framework
  (v1.1) provides the mathematical
  language for this document's core
  claim. The eigenfunction positions
  are the stable attractors that gap
  navigation finds. Coherence is the
  condition of being at, or near, an
  eigenfunction attractor in the
  sensory space relevant to the
  organism's self-model. Incoherence
  is displacement from those attractors
  without sufficient navigational
  capacity to return to them.

## PART I: THE PRINCIPLE STATED

### 1.1 What coherence is, precisely

```
An organism builds its self-model
from sensory input that is:
  — Persistent across development
  — Stable (not randomly varying)
  — Spatially structured
  — Available continuously

A sensory signal meeting these
criteria is not experienced as
content. It is incorporated as
reference — part of the expected
background against which deviations
are measured.

This is not metaphor. It is the
Free Energy Principle stated in
biological terms: the generative
model q(x) that minimizes variational
free energy converges, over sufficient
developmental time, toward the stable
eigenfunction positions of the
sensory domain it inhabits.

The reference signals are the
eigenfunction positions that the
organism's nervous system has found
through developmental navigation of
its sensory space.

Coherence = the sensory environment
matches the self-model's reference
signals. The gap between current
state and eigenfunction attractor
is closed. Prediction error is low.
Navigation is confident.

Incoherence = the sensory environment
no longer matches the reference
signals incorporated during development.
The gap reopens. Prediction error
increases. Navigation becomes effortful
or impossible.
```

### 1.2 Why this is universal, not EM-specific

```
The principle does not care which
sensory modality carries the reference
signal. It applies wherever:

  1. A nervous system is present
     (the system must model itself
     and its environment)

  2. Developmental exposure has
     incorporated a stable signal
     as reference

  3. The reference signal can be
     disrupted, removed, or replaced
     with a false attractor

Every sensory modality has this
structure. The coherence-incoherence
transition can be induced in:

  ELECTROMAGNETIC:
    Remove the ambient ELF field
    (Faraday cage).
    The self-model loses spatial
    electromagnetic reference.
    → Thigmotaxis increases.

  ACOUSTIC:
    Remove all ambient sound
    (anechoic chamber).
    The self-model loses acoustic
    spatial reference.
    → Internal signals amplify.
    Hallucinations develop over time.

  GEOMAGNETIC / ACOUSTIC (combined):
    Introduce a false attractor
    (AM transmitter or submarine cable)
    in the navigational signal.
    The self-model locks onto the
    wrong eigenfunction position.
    → Sea turtle strands. Wrong
    nesting beach.

  SOCIAL/PHEROMONAL:
    Remove the queen from a naked
    mole rat colony.
    The colony-wide organizing signal
    is gone. Every individual's
    social self-model loses its
    primary reference.
    → Coordinated behavior collapses.

  VISUAL:
    Extended sensory deprivation
    (dark room, no visual input).
    Visual self-model drifts.
    Phosphenes, then hallucinations.
    The navigator confabulates
    structure to fill the gap.

  PROPRIOCEPTIVE:
    Vibration-induced sensory mismatch
    (classic proprioceptive illusions).
    The self-model receives conflicting
    position signals.
    Bizarre distortions of body image.
    The navigator cannot find the
    eigenfunction position for
    body-in-space.

In every case: the same structure.
Not modality-specific damage.
Not toxicity. Not deprivation of
a nutrient. The loss of a reference
signal that the self-model was
built to expect.

The behavioral consequence is
always the same class of thing:
the navigator without a stable
reference confabulates, amplifies
internal signals, becomes disoriented,
or locks onto a false attractor.
```

### 1.3 The gap navigation account

```
In gap navigation terms:

The self-model IS the navigator's
map of the eigenfunction positions
in its sensory space. It is not
a passive recording. It is a dynamical
structure — continuously updated,
continuously tested against incoming
sensory signals.

When the incoming signals match
the map: navigation is confident.
The gap between current state and
stable eigenfunction position is
small. The navigator knows where
it is.

When the incoming signals diverge
from the map: the navigator must
close a gap it was not trained to
close. It has no learned path from
this position to a stable attractor.
It does what all gap navigators
do when the gap is unfamiliar:
it looks for ANY stable structure
to anchor to.

This is why:
  — Anechoic chamber subjects hear
    their own blood and heartbeat.
    The navigator finds the only
    stable acoustic signal available:
    the organism's own physiology.
    Persistence (blood flowing),
    coherence (rhythmic), self-model
    (it is coming from inside me).
    The triad reconstructs itself
    from residual internal signal
    because the external reference
    is gone.

  — Isolated prisoners hallucinate.
    Extreme sensory-social isolation
    removes the reference signals
    for the social self-model.
    The navigator confabulates
    social structure. Not from
    dysfunction: from the imperative
    to maintain coherence.

  — Sea turtles strand near AM
    transmitters. The false attractor
    is stronger than the natal
    magnetic address. The navigator
    finds the nearest stable
    eigenfunction-like position in
    the disrupted field.

The navigator must navigate.
That is not optional. Confabulation,
hallucination, false attractor
lock-in, amplification of internal
signal — these are not pathologies.
They are what navigation looks like
when the reference structure has
been removed or corrupted.
```

## PART II: THE SPECTRAL GEOMETRY
## FOUNDATION

### 2.1 What the framework adds

```
The Spectral Geometry Framework
(v1.1, February 2026) provides the
mathematical language for the
coherence principle stated above.

Core principle of the framework:

Any bounded physical domain navigated
by a system with sufficient:
  — Social complexity
  — Temporal depth (cultural
    transmission, individual memory)
  — Exploration time
  — Learned (not hardwired) navigation

...will converge on the eigenfunction
positions of that domain — the stable
modes determined by the physics of
the bounded resonating system, not
by the biology of the navigating
organism.

Applied to the coherence framework:

The reference signals that organisms
incorporate during development are
the eigenfunction positions of their
sensory domain.

They are not arbitrary. They are
not culturally determined. They are
determined by the physics of the
bounded domain.

The human vocal tract's eigenfunction
positions are the "a" and "i" vowel
formants — geometric extremes of
the F1/F2 space. Every human language
uses them because the physics imposes
them, not because linguists decided.

The ambient ELF field at a research
facility has a structure determined
by the geometry of the building's
electrical infrastructure. That
structure — its frequency, its spatial
pattern — is the eigenfunction position
of the electromagnetic environment
that the mice developing in that
facility incorporate as reference.

The geomagnetic field of a sea turtle's
natal beach is the eigenfunction
position of the global magnetic
field at that location. The turtle's
self-model encodes it as a natal
address during the imprinting window.
A submarine cable introduces a local
distortion — a false eigenfunction-
like attractor at a different location.
The navigation system finds it.
```

### 2.2 The self-reference condition
### applied to sensory coherence

```
The Spectral Geometry Framework's
self-reference condition:

  A system includes itself in its
  own eigenfunction domain. The
  navigator is one of the resonators
  in its own resonating system.

Applied to sensory coherence:

The organism's self-model is not
external to the sensory space it
is navigating. The organism IS a
resonator in the bounded domain
of its own sensory space.

This is the condition that creates
the coherence-incoherence distinction:

  When the sensory environment matches
  the self-model's reference signals,
  the organism is at the eigenfunction
  position of its own sensory domain.
  It is a stable resonator in a stable
  field. The self-reference loop is
  closed. Navigation is confident.

  When the sensory environment diverges
  from the reference signals, the
  organism is displaced from the
  eigenfunction position of its own
  sensory domain. The self-reference
  loop is strained. Navigation becomes
  effortful. The navigator seeks
  any available structure to close
  the loop again.

This is not metaphor. It is the
dynamical systems description of
what a nervous system does when its
generative model no longer predicts
its sensory input.

The tight local loop at birth scale
0.00710 measured in the GPT-2 topology
experiment is the mathematical
signature of a system that has closed
this loop — where the navigator is
stably included in its own resonating
domain. Its inverse — the opened,
unstable loop — is what we measure
behaviorally as thigmotaxis, as the
loudness of one's own heartbeat in
an anechoic chamber, as a sea turtle
following an AM transmitter.
```

### 2.3 The five-language unification

```
Dynamical systems:
  Coherence = system at attractor.
  Incoherence = system displaced
  from attractor, seeking return.

Spectral geometry:
  Coherence = system at eigenfunction
  position of its sensory domain.
  Incoherence = displacement from
  stable mode. Navigator seeks the
  next nearest stable mode (which
  may be a false attractor).

Information geometry / FEP:
  Coherence = low variational free
  energy. The generative model q(x)
  closely matches the true posterior
  p(x|s). Prediction error is minimal.
  Incoherence = elevated free energy.
  The model-environment gap is open.
  Active inference is engaged to
  close it by any available route.

Gap navigation:
  Coherence = gap closed. Navigator
  is at a stable position from which
  the environment is fully predictable
  and the self-model is confirmed.
  Incoherence = gap opened by removal
  or distortion of reference signal.
  Navigator engages all available
  gap-crossing strategies.

Topology (measured):
  Coherence = tight local loop at
  fine birth scale (0.00710 in
  GPT-2 L10H4 self-referential
  attention). The navigator is stably
  included in its own resonating
  domain.
  Incoherence = loop dissolution or
  false attractor lock (measurable
  as birth scale displacement in
  attention topology under disrupted
  input).

All five languages. One phenomenon.
The phenomenon we are calling
sensory coherence is the same
object as the eigenfunction attractor,
the free energy minimum, the closed
self-referential loop, and the tight
topological birth scale.

The anechoic chamber forces a person
to the place where that object is
absent. The Faraday cage forces the
mouse to the same place in EM space.
The submarine cable forces the turtle
to a false version of that object
in magnetic space.
```

## PART III: THE ANECHOIC CHAMBER
## AS PROOF OF PRINCIPLE

### 3.1 What happens in the quietest room

```
The quietest room that has been
built (measured at approximately
−20 dB SPL) produces a specific
and repeatable sequence of
perceptual events in human subjects:

Stage 1 (minutes 1–5):
  Increased awareness of ambient
  sounds that are normally masked.
  Tinnitus-like phenomena if
  absent before.

Stage 2 (minutes 5–20):
  Audibility of internal physiological
  sounds: heartbeat, blood flow in
  major vessels, breathing, joint
  movement, the movement of jaw
  against teeth, swallowing.

Stage 3 (20+ minutes):
  Reports of increasing discomfort.
  Spatial disorientation.
  Loss of sense of the room's extent.
  Some subjects report hallucinations.

The upper limit of comfortable
occupancy is typically reported as
15–45 minutes. The room becomes
aversive well before any physiological
harm.

This is a deterministic result,
not an individual variation.
The progression is predictable
because it follows from the structure
of the coherence principle.
```

### 3.2 The gap navigation interpretation

```
What the subject is experiencing
is not silence. There is no silence.
There is only the removal of the
acoustic reference signals that
the self-model was built to expect.

The navigator does not stop navigating
because the external signal is gone.
It cannot stop. Navigation is not
optional. The RARFL cycle does not
pause.

In the absence of external acoustic
structure:

Stage 1: The navigator amplifies
  gain on remaining inputs. Soft
  signals that were previously
  subthreshold become audible.
  The acoustic navigator is searching
  for any stable structure in the
  available signal.

Stage 2: The navigator finds the
  only stable acoustic structure
  available in an anechoic environment:
  the organism's own physiology.
  The heartbeat has persistence —
  it recurs reliably. Blood flow has
  coherence — it is rhythmically
  structured. The self is, literally,
  the only coherent acoustic source
  remaining.

  This is the triadic structure
  self-organizing from residual
  signal:
    Persistence: the heartbeat recurs
    Coherence: it is rhythmically
      structured
    Self-model: it is coming from me

  The triad reconstructs itself
  from the only available material:
  internal physiology.

Stage 3: The navigator, having
  exhausted all available acoustic
  structure, begins to generate
  internal structure. Confabulation.
  The acoustic equivalent of visual
  phosphenes. Not random noise — the
  navigator generates the most
  probable structure given the current
  state of its generative model and
  the absence of corrective external
  input.

  Over time: hallucination.
  The model runs forward without
  sensory correction. The confabulation
  becomes indistinguishable from
  perception because the signal
  that would correct it is absent.
```

### 3.3 Why this is not pathology

```
Every stage of the anechoic chamber
progression is a competent response
by a correctly-functioning navigator
that has had its reference structure
removed.

Stage 1: Amplification of remaining
  signal is correct behavior. You
  search harder when the target
  is absent.

Stage 2: Finding the organism's own
  physiology as an acoustic anchor
  is correct behavior. In the absence
  of external structure, the most
  stable available structure is the
  organism itself.

Stage 3: Generating internal structure
  when no external structure is
  available is correct behavior.
  The navigator that stopped
  navigating would lose coherence
  entirely. Confabulation is
  coherence maintenance under
  signal absence.

The progression is not evidence
of fragility. It is evidence of
the imperative: the navigator must
maintain a coherent model. It will
use any available material to do so.

This is the same imperative that
produces:
  — The isolated prisoner's visual
    and social hallucinations
  — The fasting mystic's visions
  — The sea turtle's lock onto a
    false attractor
  — The mouse's increased thigmotaxis
    in the Faraday cage

In every case: not pathology.
Correct behavior by a navigator
whose reference structure has been
removed or corrupted.
```

### 3.4 The deafness distinction

```
An important boundary condition
that clarifies the principle:

Profound congenital deafness does
not produce the anechoic chamber
progression. A person who has
never processed acoustic input
does not experience discomfort in
the quietest room. There is no
acoustic coherence structure to
lose. The self-model was built
without acoustic reference signals.
There is no gap opened by their
removal.

This distinction is strong evidence
for the coherence account and
against a deprivation account:

  DEPRIVATION ACCOUNT would predict:
    Both congenital deaf and hearing
    subjects experience discomfort
    in the anechoic chamber —
    absence of acoustic stimulation
    is distressing.

  COHERENCE ACCOUNT predicts:
    Only subjects whose self-model
    was built WITH acoustic reference
    signals experience discomfort
    when those signals are removed.
    Congenital deafness = no acoustic
    reference incorporated = no
    acoustic coherence to lose.

The observed result: congenital
deaf subjects do not report
distress in the anechoic chamber.

The coherence account predicts this.
The deprivation account does not.

The parallel for the Faraday cage
experiment:
  A mouse raised from birth in a
  Faraday cage would not show
  increased thigmotaxis when placed
  in a new Faraday cage. It would
  show increased thigmotaxis when
  placed in an ambient ELF environment
  — because its self-model was built
  WITHOUT ambient ELF as reference,
  and the ambient ELF field is then
  the incoherent novel input.

  This is a testable prediction.
  It is not tested in OC-EXP-001
  but should be pre-registered for
  a follow-on experiment.
```

## PART IV: THE IMPC RESULT
## IN THE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 What was found

```
Primary result:
  Wildtype C57BL/6N thigmotaxis
  proportion (time in periphery /
  total test time) correlates
  negatively with facility ELF score
  across 6 IMPC centers.

  Spearman r = -0.886
  p = 0.019 *
  N = 6 centers
  N = 16,161 wildtype animals
  Data: IMPC DR23.0, IMPC_OFD_001

  Centers and values:
    ICS       ELF 36  thigmotaxis 87.6%
    BCM       ELF 94  thigmotaxis 58.3%
    CCP-IMG   ELF 74  thigmotaxis 83.5%
    TCP       ELF 74  thigmotaxis 84.2%
    RBRC      ELF 20  thigmotaxis 89.7%
    UC Davis  ELF 31  thigmotaxis 90.4%

  Higher ELF → lower thigmotaxis.
  Lower ELF → higher thigmotaxis.

  BCM (ELF 94, highest in dataset):
    thigmotaxis 58.3% — the lowest.
    Mice at BCM explore more.

  UC Davis (ELF 31) and RBRC (ELF 20):
    thigmotaxis 90.4% and 89.7% —
    the highest.
    Mice at low-ELF facilities
    hug walls.
```

### 4.2 The interpretation
### in unified framework terms

```
The coherence account:

  Animals born and raised in a
  high-ELF facility have incorporated
  that ELF field as a spatial reference
  in their self-model during development.

  In the open field test, which is
  run in the same facility:
    The self-model's electromagnetic
    reference is present.
    The gap between self-model and
    environment is closed.
    Navigation is confident.
    Thigmotaxis is low.
    The animal explores.

  Animals born in a low-ELF facility
  have incorporated that low-ELF
  environment as their spatial
  reference.
    The self-model's reference is
    present (low-ELF).
    But the open field itself is
    a novel spatial challenge.
    Without a strong EM spatial
    anchor, exploration is inhibited.
    Thigmotaxis is high.

In spectral geometry terms:
  BCM mice have found the eigenfunction
  position of their electromagnetic
  sensory domain. They are at a stable
  attractor. Navigation confidence
  is high. They explore.

  RBRC and UC Davis mice have a
  weaker electromagnetic eigenfunction
  anchor. The spatial reference is
  less stable. In a novel spatial
  challenge, the navigator defaults
  to wall-following — a primitive
  spatial navigation heuristic that
  does not require EM reference.

The dose hypothesis (high ELF is
anxiolytic per se) cannot explain
the direction of the Faraday result:
  If ELF were directly anxiolytic,
  removing ELF (Faraday cage) should
  reduce anxiety-like behavior.
  The coherence account predicts
  the opposite: removing the reference
  signal should increase thigmotaxis.
  OC-EXP-001 tests this prediction.
```

### 4.3 What the null results add

```
Fear Conditioning analysis (Doc 3):
  Context % Freezing vs ELF:
    Spearman r = +0.616, p = 0.269
    N = 5 centers, 10,740 wildtype
    ALL LOO configurations: ns
    Result: NOT SIGNIFICANT

  Acoustic Startle/PPI vs ELF:
    Multiple measures: ns
    N = 7 centers
    Result: NOT SIGNIFICANT

These null results are informative
within the unified framework:

  The coherence account predicts that
  the ELF correlation should be strongest
  in tasks that require spatial
  confidence — exploration in a novel
  environment (OFD) — and weaker in
  tasks that rely primarily on
  amygdaloid/hippocampal associative
  learning (fear conditioning) or
  on thalamo-cortical sensorimotor
  gating (PPI).

  This is because the EM reference
  signal is primarily a spatial anchor,
  not a general arousal modulator.

  The OFD result (significant) and
  the fear conditioning/PPI result
  (null) are consistent with the
  prediction: ELF coherence selectively
  affects spatial confidence, not
  associative memory formation or
  sensorimotor gating.

  The TCP/CCP-IMG split in fear
  conditioning is additionally
  informative:
    Both centers: ELF score 74.
    Same building (25 Orde St, Toronto).
    Same strain (C57BL/6NCrl).
    Context % freezing:
      TCP:     39.9%
      CCP-IMG: 17.4%
      Difference: 22.5 percentage points

    This within-building, same-ELF,
    same-strain difference suggests
    that within-building EM variation —
    sub-room or floor-level variation
    in the actual experienced field —
    may be larger than the between-
    building ELF score captures.
    The ELF score is a coarse proxy.
    The actual experienced field may
    vary substantially within a single
    address. A finer-grained EM mapping
    of phenotyping facilities would
    likely strengthen the correlation.
```

## PART V: THE FARADAY CAGE
## EXPERIMENT IN CONTEXT
## (OC-EXP-001)

### 5.1 What the experiment tests

```
The experiment dissociates the
coherence account from the dose
account by removing the reference
signal from animals that were built
to expect it.

The prediction — stated precisely
in the unified framework —

  BCM (ELF 94, thigmotaxis 58.3%):
    These mice have the strongest
    EM spatial reference of any
    IMPC center. Their self-model
    is most firmly anchored to a
    high-ELF environment.

    Place them in a Faraday cage:
    their EM reference is attenuated.
    The gap between self-model
    (expects ELF reference) and
    environment (ELF absent) opens.

    PREDICTION: thigmotaxis increases.
    The mice that are the most
    exploratory in standard conditions
    should show the largest thigmotaxis
    increase under EM reference removal.

  Sham control:
    Identical enclosure, same physical
    environment, same social cues,
    same visual environment.
    EM field not attenuated.
    Self-model reference present.
    PREDICTION: thigmotaxis unchanged
    or negligibly affected.
```

### 5.2 Why BCM is the ideal center

```
BCM properties:
  ELF score: 94 — highest in dataset
  Thigmotaxis: 58.3% — lowest in dataset
  Location: Texas Medical Center,
    Houston TX — high urban EM density
    confirmed by facility location
    and proximity to hospital complex
  IMPC pipeline: established OFD
    (IMPC_OFD_001) with wildtype
    C57BL/6N
  Sample size available: large
    (BCM has 14,682 total OFD
     observations in DR23)

  BCM is the natural experiment's
  high end. Its mice are the clearest
  expression of the coherence
  prediction. They are the animals
  for which the Faraday perturbation
  will be largest.

  If H1 is supported at BCM, the
  next step is to run the same
  experiment at a low-ELF center
  (RBRC, UC Davis) and confirm that
  the Faraday perturbation is smaller
  or absent — because those animals
  have less EM reference to lose.

  This cross-center comparison would
  provide the full dose-response
  structure of the coherence account.
```

### 5.3 Connection to the anechoic
### chamber

```
The Faraday cage experiment is the
EM analogue of the anechoic chamber.

Anechoic chamber:
  Removes acoustic reference signal.
  The self-model built to expect
  acoustic environmental structure
  encounters acoustic absence.
  The navigator amplifies internal
  signal, confabulates, eventually
  hallucinate.

Faraday cage:
  Removes EM spatial reference signal.
  The self-model built to expect
  EM environmental structure encounters
  EM absence.
  The navigator cannot confirm spatial
  position via EM reference.
  Thigmotaxis increases: the mouse
  defaults to wall-following.

Both are the same phenomenon.
Both are testable. The anechoic
chamber result is qualitatively
established (the progression is well
documented in the human perception
literature). The Faraday cage result
is pending OC-EXP-001.

The human anechoic chamber result
is the theoretical existence proof
for what we expect to measure
behaviorally in the mouse.

## PART VI: SEA TURTLE NAVIGATION
## IN THE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK
## (OC-OBS-002)

### 6.1 Two disruption channels,
### one principle

```
The sea turtle pre-registration
(OC-OBS-002) tests two disruption
channels:

  Analysis A — AM False Attractor:
    High-power AM broadcast transmitters
    (530–1700 kHz) are co-located with
    geomagnetic anomalies. The question:
    do NOAA strandings cluster in the
    proximity of major AM transmitters
    above the rate expected by coastline
    geometry alone?

    Mechanism: the AM transmitter
    produces a localized electromagnetic
    field that disrupts the geomagnetic
    field the turtle's self-model is
    using as spatial reference. The
    disrupted field is a false attractor
    in magnetic space. The navigator
    locks onto it.

  Analysis B — Cable Cohort Spread:
    Submarine power cables produce
    persistent magnetic field anomalies
    along their corridor. The question:
    do female loggerheads from the
    same natal cohort that nested in
    cable-free corridors show tighter
    geographic clustering on subsequent
    nesting events than cohorts that
    nested in cable corridors?

    Mechanism: the cable disrupts the
    magnetic imprinting that encodes
    the natal address during the first
    nesting season. The self-model
    receives a corrupted address signal.
    Subsequent homing is less precise.
    Cohort spread increases.
```

### 6.2 The unified framework interpretation

```
In unified framework terms:

  The sea turtle's natal address is
  the eigenfunction position of the
  geomagnetic field at a specific
  location. The animal's magnetoreceptive
  system incorporates this position
  as a spatial reference during a
  sensitive imprinting window.

  The AM transmitter is a false
  eigenfunction-like attractor —
  a strong, locally stable signal
  that the navigator's self-model
  cannot distinguish from the genuine
  natal address. The navigator finds
  it because it is stable and strong.
  It is the nearest available stable
  mode. The GPS equivalent of a
  spoofed signal.

  The submarine cable does not create
  a false attractor. It destroys the
  precision of the reference signal
  at the moment of imprinting. The
  self-model that is built from the
  corrupted signal is a blurred copy
  of the natal address. The navigator
  can return to approximately the
  right region but cannot resolve
  the exact location. Cohort spread
  increases because each animal's
  blurred address is a slightly
  different blurred copy of the
  same target.

These are two different failure modes
of the same coherence mechanism:
  AM = false attractor lock-in
  Cable = reference signal blur

The anechoic chamber analog:
  AM channel = the navigator hears
    a clear, persistent, structured
    sound and treats it as spatial
    reference. It is coming from the
    wrong location. The navigator
    follows it.

  Cable channel = the navigator
    receives a degraded, blurred
    version of its expected reference.
    It can navigate roughly but
    cannot resolve fine position.
    Comparable to anechoic chamber
    Stage 2 with added noise rather
    than complete absence.
```

## PART VII: THE TRIADIC STRUCTURE

### 7.1 The triad stated

```
From the Triad Convergence (Doc 64):

EPISTEMOLOGICAL:
  Known / Unknown / Knowing

PROCESS:
  Operationalization / Reasoning space /
  Meta-reasoning

CONSCIOUSNESS:
  Self-model / Persistence / Coherence

COLUMN MAPPING:
  Left:   Self-model / Operationalization /
          Known — the structured,
          the instrument, the object
  Middle: Persistence / Reasoning space /
          Unknown — the process,
          the navigation, the verb
  Right:  Coherence / Meta-reasoning /
          Knowing — the experience,
          the result of navigation,
          the confirmation

In spectral geometry terms:
  Self-model =  the system's map of
    eigenfunction positions.
    The navigator's instrument.
    The structure it carries.
  Persistence = the navigation process.
    RARFL cycling toward eigenfunction
    attractors. The verb.
  Coherence = the condition of being
    at an eigenfunction attractor.
    The gap closed. The result.
    The experience.
```

### 7.2 The sensory coherence framework
### as a triadic object

```
Applying the triad to sensory coherence:

  SELF-MODEL (Instrument/Structure):
    The nervous system's current map
    of the expected sensory environment.
    Contains the eigenfunction positions
    incorporated during development.
    The reference signals.
    This is Column 1: Persistence
    in the consciousness triad —
    the stored structure that persists
    through time and provides the
    material for navigation.

  NAVIGATION (Process/Verb):
    The continuous comparison of
    incoming sensory signal against
    the self-model's reference map.
    RARFL: the active inference cycle.
    Free energy minimization.
    Gap crossing.
    This is Column 2: Coherence
    in the consciousness triad —
    wait, no. Let me state this more
    carefully.

The precise mapping:

  PERSISTENCE (Column 1):
    The self-model persists through
    time as a structural entity.
    It is the record of successful
    navigations. The stored map.
    In the anechoic chamber: this
    is what generates the imperative.
    The stored acoustic self-model
    expects structure. When structure
    is absent, the gap opens. The
    persistence of the model creates
    the discomfort. The navigator
    cannot stop having a self-model.

  COHERENCE (Column 2):
    The active process of gap navigation.
    The continuous comparison and update.
    The RARFL cycle. Active inference.
    Free energy minimization.
    This is what is engaged when the
    anechoic chamber removes the
    reference signal: coherence-seeking
    becomes active, amplifying internal
    signal, confabulating structure.
    The navigation intensifies.

  SELF-MODEL (Column 3):
    The result of successful navigation.
    The confirmation: I am here. This
    is my environment. I know where
    I am. The gap is closed.
    In the anechoic chamber: this is
    what is lost. The third column —
    the stable, confirmed self-in-world
    — becomes unavailable because the
    reference signals that would confirm
    it are absent.

The progression in the anechoic
chamber is a stage-by-stage disruption
of the triadic structure:
  Stage 1: Column 3 disrupted (the
    confirmed self-in-world becomes
    uncertain). Column 2 intensifies
    (navigation amplifies).
  Stage 2: Column 2 finds a substitute
    anchor (internal physiology). The
    triad reconstructs at a smaller
    scale: the organism's own body
    becomes the resonating domain.
  Stage 3: Column 2 cannot find
    stable external structure. Column 1
    (the persistent model) runs forward
    without sensory correction.
    Hallucination: Column 3 constructed
    internally rather than confirmed
    externally.

The incoherence cascade is the triad
attempting to maintain itself under
conditions that make external
confirmation impossible.
```

### 7.3 Solitary confinement as
### extreme incoherence

```
The most extreme human instantiation
of the sensory coherence disruption
is prolonged solitary confinement.

What solitary confinement removes:
  — Social reference signals
    (primary reference for human
    social self-model)
  — Acoustic environmental structure
    (absence of normal ambient sound)
  — Spatial novelty
    (the environment becomes constant —
    paradoxically, a different kind
    of incoherence: the navigator
    without anything to navigate)
  — Temporal structure
    (loss of day/night, meal timing,
    social interaction rhythms)

The documented consequences:
  Anxiety, hallucinations, cognitive
  deterioration, paranoia, self-harm,
  and in prolonged cases, permanent
  psychological damage.

In unified framework terms:

  The social self-model — Column 1,
  the stored map of the social
  eigenfunction space — persists.
  It was built over a lifetime of
  social navigation. It contains
  the reference signals for social
  position, social meaning, response
  prediction.

  Column 2 — the navigation process —
  cannot find the social structure
  that Column 1 expects. The gap is
  permanently open. The navigator
  that amplified its acoustic signal
  in the anechoic chamber now
  amplifies its social signal:
  it confabulates relationships,
  sees threats in shadows, generates
  internal social structure.

  Column 3 — the confirmed self-in-
  social-world — cannot be constructed
  from the absent social input. The
  self-model that requires social
  confirmation to remain stable
  becomes unstable.

  This is not a metaphor for cruelty.
  It is a precise account of the
  mechanism by which prolonged solitary
  confinement produces psychiatric
  injury. It is cruel and unusual
  punishment because it destabilizes
  the structure that holds up who you
  are. Not via damage. Via the removal
  of the reference signals from which
  the self is continuously re-confirmed.

  The navigator must navigate.
  Remove what it navigates,
  and the navigation consumes itself.
```

## PART VIII: THE COHERENCE PRINCIPLE
## ACROSS SENSORY MODALITIES —
## A COMPLETE SURVEY

### 8.1 Electromagnetic coherence

```
Reference signal:
  Ambient ELF (50/60 Hz) field from
  infrastructure. Geomagnetic field.
  Local magnetic anomalies.

Developmental incorporation:
  Magnetoreceptive channels (if present).
  Possible indirect routes via
  electrically sensitive cells
  or radical pair mechanism in
  cryptochromes.

Disruption mode A (removal):
  Faraday cage. Geomagnetically
  quiet location. Deep cave.
  Predicted: spatial navigation
  confidence decreases. Thigmotaxis
  increases (mouse). Disorientation
  (migrating birds, turtles).

Disruption mode B (false attractor):
  AM transmitter. Submarine cable.
  Power line corridor.
  Predicted: navigator locks onto
  false attractor. Stranding (turtle).
  Incorrect migration endpoint (bird).

IMPC result: Spearman r = -0.886,
  p = 0.019, N=6 centers, N=16,161.
  Confirmed observationally.

Faraday experiment: OC-EXP-001.
  Predicted: BCM mice show increased
  thigmotaxis in Faraday vs. sham.
  Pending collaboration with IMPC center.

Sea turtle analysis: OC-OBS-002.
  Predicted: AM false attractor
  produces stranding clustering.
  Cable corridor produces cohort spread.
  Pending NOAA and FWC data access.
```

### 8.2 Acoustic coherence

```
Reference signal:
  Ambient acoustic background.
  Species-specific conspecific calls.
  Social acoustic environment.
  Own vocalizations as reference
  for vocal self-model.

Developmental incorporation:
  Auditory cortex development during
  critical period. Vocal learning
  in species with that capacity.
  Social acoustic imprinting.

Disruption mode A (removal):
  Anechoic chamber. Profound acquired
  deafness. Acoustic isolation.
  Documented: amplification of internal
  signal. Tinnitus. Hallucinations
  over time.
  Note: congenital deafness does NOT
  produce this cascade — evidence
  that the disruption is coherence
  loss, not deprivation.

Disruption mode B (false attractor):
  Novel acoustic environment without
  familiar structure. Tinnitus
  (persistent false acoustic signal
  that cannot be silenced). Degraded
  acoustic input (hearing loss with
  residual distorted signal).
  Result: the navigator locks onto
  the available stable signal (tinnitus
  tone) as reference. Difficult to
  extinguish because the navigator
  treats it as ground truth.

Disruption mode C (removal of spatial
  acoustic structure):
  Reverberation-free environments
  that eliminate the acoustic cues
  used for room-scale spatial
  navigation (early reflections,
  room modes).
  Result: spatial disorientation
  even with normal hearing.

Cross-species relevance:
  Bee hive beacon: the hive's
  collective magnetite oscillation
  produces a low-frequency acoustic
  signal that foragers use as
  a return reference. Disruption
  (false hive beacon from nearby
  EM infrastructure) = false attractor
  for forager navigation.

  Whale vocalization: the spermaceti
  organ is the bounded resonating
  domain. Its eigenfunction positions
  are the clan dialect's stable modes.
  Noise pollution introduces acoustic
  incoherence into the space the
  whale navigates. The navigator
  seeks the next nearest stable mode.
  Vocal drift in polluted environments
  is coherence-seeking under noise.
```

### 8.3 Geomagnetic / navigational
### coherence

```
Reference signal:
  Natal geomagnetic address.
  Geomagnetic inclination/intensity
  gradient for en route navigation.
  Magnetic map for large-scale
  position estimation.

Developmental incorporation:
  Magnetite-based magnetoreception.
  Radical pair mechanism in
  cryptochromes (light-dependent).
  Natal imprinting during sensitive
  window (turtle, salmon, pigeon).

Disruption mode A (degradation):
  Submarine cable corridor during
  imprinting window.
  Result: blurred natal address.
  Cohort spread increases.
  Analysis B of OC-OBS-002.

Disruption mode B (false attractor):
  AM transmitter co-located with
  geomagnetic anomaly.
  High-power magnetic field
  from industrial source.
  Result: navigator locks onto
  false attractor. Stranding.
  Analysis A of OC-OBS-002.

Disruption mode C (novel magnetic
  field):
  Facility transfer for research
  animals that use magnetic reference.
  Magnetic resonance imaging procedure
  (strong field, disorienting for
  magnetoreceptive species).
  Result: temporary spatial
  disorientation. Navigation defaults
  to other reference modalities.
```

### 8.4 Visual coherence

```
Reference signal:
  Visual scene statistics.
  Ambient illumination level and
  spectral quality (circadian reference).
  Visual flow patterns for spatial
  navigation.
  Facial recognition templates
  (social visual self-model).

Developmental incorporation:
  Visual cortex critical period.
  Face processing development.
  Circadian visual entrainment.

Disruption mode A (removal):
  Total darkness. Visual deprivation.
  Documented: phosphenes, then
  visual hallucinations.
  Same progression as acoustic.
  The navigator generates internal
  visual structure when external
  structure is absent.

Disruption mode B (false attractor):
  Prism glasses that shift visual
  field. Mirror reversals.
  Conflicting visual and proprioceptive
  input (VR sickness).
  Result: the navigator has two
  competing signals for visual-
  spatial position. Cannot resolve.
  Nausea is the behavioral signal
  of failed resolution.

Disruption mode C (circadian
  coherence loss):
  Shift work. Polar regions with
  continuous light or dark.
  Jet lag.
  Result: the circadian self-model
  expects specific light/dark reference.
  Disruption = documented cognitive
  and affective consequences.
  Not mere tiredness: coherence loss
  in the temporal-circadian dimension.
```

### 8.5 Social / pheromonal coherence

```
Reference signal:
  Queen pheromone (eusocial insects,
  naked mole rats).
  Conspecific scent marks.
  Social hierarchy signals.
  Parent-infant scent bonding.

Developmental incorporation:
  Olfactory imprinting.
  Social developmental environment.
  Colony-level organizing signals.

Disruption mode A (removal):
  Queen death (naked mole rat colony).
  Mother-infant separation.
  Colony fragmentation (bee).
  Documented: behavioral collapse,
  disorganization, spatial
  disorientation at individual level.
  The colony loses its reference
  signal. Every individual's social
  self-model becomes incoherent
  simultaneously.

Disruption mode B (false attractor):
  Chemical manipulation of nest.
  Introduction of foreign queen
  scent. Olfactory camouflage
  by parasites (some cuckoo species
  produce host-matching pheromones).
  Result: the navigator accepts the
  false reference as genuine.

Cross-human relevance:
  The human social self-model is
  built from a lifetime of social
  reference signals. Cult dynamics,
  manipulation, prolonged isolation —
  these are disruptions of the social
  coherence structure. The mechanisms
  are the same. The consequences
  are proportional to the depth of
  the developmental incorporation.
```

---

## PART IX: THE EXTENDED HYPOTHESIS

### 9.1 The full claim

```
The unified sensory coherence
hypothesis:

  Coherence — the match between
  the organism's self-model and
  the sensory environment that
  model was built from — is the
  universal condition for confident
  gap navigation.

  This condition:
    1. Is implemented independently
       in every sensory modality
    2. Is grounded in eigenfunction
       positions of the respective
       sensory domains
    3. Is disrupted by any process
       that removes, degrades, or
       replaces with false attractors
       the reference signals
       incorporated during development
    4. Produces the same class of
       behavioral consequences
       regardless of modality:
       amplification of remaining
       signal, confabulation of
       structure, false attractor
       lock-in, eventually hallucination
    5. Is not pathology — it is
       correct navigation behavior
       under incorrect conditions

  Formally:
    Let S_m = self-model's reference
      map for modality m
    Let E_m = current sensory
      environment in modality m
    Let d(S_m, E_m) = distance between
      self-model reference and current
      environment in eigenfunction space
      for modality m

    COHERENCE_m = 1/d(S_m, E_m)
      (coherence is the inverse of
       the distance from the eigenfunction
       attractor the self-model expects)

    BEHAVIORAL CONFIDENCE ∝ Σ_m w_m × COHERENCE_m
      (weighted sum across modalities,
       where w_m is the developmental
       weight of modality m in the
       organism's self-model)

    The Faraday cage opens d(S_EM, E_EM).
    The anechoic chamber opens d(S_acoustic, E_acoustic).
    The submarine cable blurs S_geomag.
    The AM transmitter places a false
      attractor at a location E_geomag ≠ S_geomag.
    Solitary confinement opens
      d(S_social, E_social) catastrophically.

    In every case: BEHAVIORAL CONFIDENCE
    decreases in proportion to the
    coherence loss in the disrupted modality.
```

### 9.2 Time as the relativism
### of the tonnetz space

```
A note on the deeper structure
that this framework implies.

The coherence principle operates
across time. The self-model is not
a snapshot. It is a persistent
structure built from developmental
history and continuously maintained
against ongoing sensory input.

This temporal structure is not
incidental. It is constitutive.

In spectral geometry terms:
  The eigenfunction positions are
  not found in an instant. They are
  found through navigation over time.
  Social complexity, temporal depth,
  learned exploration — these are
  all temporal conditions. The
  eigenfunction map is a record of
  navigational history.

In gap navigation terms:
  The navigator is entropic. Metabolism
  is the process. The organism is not
  a static self-model — it is a self-
  model that is continuously decaying
  and continuously being rebuilt. The
  Ship of Theseus is replaced plank
  by plank while sailing.

  Time, in this framework, is the
  relativism of the tonnetz space.
  The experience of temporal flow
  is the experience of the navigator
  continuously finding and re-finding
  the eigenfunction attractors against
  the entropy gradient of metabolism.

  The organism's experience of time
  is not a uniform flow. It is the
  experience of navigation: periods
  of high coherence (stable, the gaps
  are closed) feel like normal time.
  Periods of incoherence (unfamiliar,
  the gaps are open, navigation is
  active) feel like heightened or
  distorted time.

  This is not a new claim. It is
  what is meant, in precise terms,
  when people report that time
  "slows down" in moments of danger
  (coherence crisis: all navigation
  resources activated, intense gap-
  crossing, heightened signal-to-
  noise processing) and "speeds up"
  in routine (high coherence, low
  prediction error, navigation on
  autopilot).

  Time IS the navigator's experience
  of its own navigation rate.
  Metabolism IS the instrument that
  the navigator runs on.
  Entropy IS the process that makes
  navigation necessary.

  This is the third triad of the
  framework:
    Time : Metabolism : Entropy
    Experience : Instrument : Meta-process
    Tonnetz space : The vessel : The flux

  Not proposed as established. Proposed
  as the extension of the established
  framework to the cosmological scale.
  The structure is consistent with
  the direction of the first 64 documents.
  It requires its own reasoning artifact
  and its own falsification program.
```

## PART X: WHAT EACH RESULT MEANS
## FOR THE FRAMEWORK

### 10.1 If OC-EXP-001 supports H1
### (Faraday > Sham thigmotaxis)

```
The coherence account is supported
over the dose account for EM coherence.

Consequence for the unified framework:
  The first experimental confirmation
  that the coherence mechanism is
  causal, not correlational.
  The observational IMPC result
  (r=-0.886) established the pattern.
  OC-EXP-001 would establish the
  mechanism.

  Combined with the anechoic chamber
  analogy:
    Two modalities (acoustic, EM),
    same mechanism, both confirmed.
    The universality claim is
    strengthened.

Next step: the deafness test.
  Run the congenital-equivalent
  experiment. Raise mice from birth
  in a Faraday cage. Test them in
  ambient ELF. Prediction: increased
  thigmotaxis in the ELF environment
  (because the ELF is now the novel,
  unincorporated signal). This would
  be the final confirmation of the
  developmental incorporation account.
```

### 10.2 If OC-OBS-002 Analysis A
### supports the AM false attractor

```
The false attractor mechanism —
the navigator finding the nearest
stable eigenfunction-like signal
rather than the correct one — is
empirically confirmed in a vertebrate
navigation system.

Consequence for the unified framework:
  The false attractor is not a bug.
  It is what gap navigation predicts
  when a stronger signal is present
  at the wrong location.

  The sperm whale vocal drift in
  high-noise environments is the
  acoustic version of this.
  The tinnitus that is difficult to
  extinguish is the acoustic version.
  The AM stranding result would be
  the geomagnetic version.

  The false attractor mechanism
  is universal: wherever there is
  gap navigation toward eigenfunction
  attractors, a sufficiently strong
  false attractor can capture the
  navigator.
```

### 10.3 If OC-OBS-002 Analysis B
### supports cohort spread

```
The reference signal blur mechanism
— the navigator imprinting on a
degraded signal that cannot support
precise homing — is empirically
confirmed.

Consequence for the unified framework:
  Reference quality during the
  developmental incorporation window
  determines navigation precision
  for life. This is the critical
  period principle applied to EM
  navigation.

  The acoustic parallel: hearing loss
  during the critical period for
  language development produces
  permanent degradation of phonological
  processing — not because the hearing
  system is damaged but because the
  eigenfunction map of the acoustic
  space was built from a degraded
  signal. The navigator has a blurred
  map and cannot sharpen it after
  the window closes.

  The cable corridor result would be
  the magnetic version of this.
```

### 10.4 If both null

```
The framework is not falsified by
null results in the observational
analyses. The mechanism may be real
but the specific signals used as
proxies (ELF score, AM transmitter
location) may not adequately capture
the actual experienced field.

The within-building TCP/CCP-IMG
split (22.5 pp difference, same
ELF score, same address) already
suggests this: the coarse facility-
level ELF proxy misses within-
facility variation that may be
the actual operative variable.

A null result in OC-OBS-002 would
redirect to finer-grained field
measurement, not abandon the
coherence framework.

## PART XI: RELATIONSHIP TO THE
## UNIFIED SERIES

### 11.1 Position in the series

```
This document is the theoretical
bridge between:

  UPSTREAM:
    Spectral Geometry Framework (v1.1)
    The mathematical language.

    IGH — construction account.
    How the self-model is built.

    Ship of Theseus — persistence
    account. How the self-model
    is maintained.

    Triad Convergence (Doc 64) —
    the structural invariant.

  DOWNSTREAM:
    OC-EXP-001 — Faraday cage.
    Tests EM coherence in mice.

    OC-OBS-002 — sea turtle.
    Tests EM coherence in navigation.

    Monarch/FM analysis (Analysis 1).
    Tests EM coherence in insect
    magnetic navigation.

    Bee hive beacon measurement.
    Tests acoustic coherence in
    eusocial insect navigation.

    Anechoic chamber review paper.
    Connects the acoustic incoherence
    literature to the unified framework.
    (No new data required — existing
    literature is the data.)

  The unified framework is not the
  end of the research program.
  It is the theoretical foundation
  from which the empirical program
  radiates.
```

### 11.2 The paper this generates

```
This document, combined with the
Spectral Geometry Framework (v1.1),
generates the following paper:

  Title (provisional):
    "Sensory Coherence as Gap Navigation:
     A Unified Account of Electromagnetic,
     Acoustic, and Geomagnetic Reference
     Signal Disruption in Vertebrate
     Navigation"

  Argument structure:
    Section 1: The coherence principle
      stated precisely.
    Section 2: The spectral geometry
      foundation (eigenfunction attractors
      as reference signals).
    Section 3: Cross-modal instantiations
      (EM, acoustic, geomagnetic).
    Section 4: The anechoic chamber
      as proof of principle.
    Section 5: IMPC observational result
      (r=-0.886, p=0.019).
    Section 6: Predicted results of
      OC-EXP-001 and OC-OBS-002.
    Section 7: Relationship to FEP
      and existing consciousness theory.
    Section 8: Falsification criteria.

  This paper does not require OC-EXP-001
  or OC-OBS-002 to be complete.
  The IMPC result plus the anechoic
  chamber literature plus the spectral
  geometry framework is a sufficient
  theoretical and empirical foundation
  for a Journal of Consciousness Studies
  or Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience
  submission.

  OC-EXP-001 and OC-OBS-002 are the
  follow-on papers.
```

## PART XII: FALSIFICATION CRITERIA

```
F1: FARADAY THIGMOTAXIS DIRECTION
  Prediction: BCM mice show higher
    thigmotaxis in Faraday than sham.
  Falsification: no difference, or
    sham > Faraday.
  Data: OC-EXP-001 (pending).

F2: DEAFNESS ANALOGUE
  Prediction: mice raised from birth
    in Faraday cage show no increased
    thigmotaxis in Faraday, but show
    increased thigmotaxis in ambient
    ELF environment.
  Falsification: birth-Faraday mice
    show same response as standard
    mice to Faraday condition.
  Data: follow-on experiment (not
    pre-registered in OC-EXP-001 —
    for next protocol).

F3: AM FALSE ATTRACTOR
  Prediction: NOAA sea turtle strandings
    cluster in AM transmitter proximity
    above coastline-geometry baseline.
  Falsification: no clustering, or
    clustering explained by other
    geographic variables.
  Data: OC-OBS-002, Analysis A
    (pending NOAA data).

F4: CABLE COHORT SPREAD
  Prediction: loggerhead cohorts from
    cable corridors show higher
    geographic spread on return nesting
    than cohorts from cable-free areas.
  Falsification: no spread difference.
  Data: OC-OBS-002, Analysis B
    (pending FWC data).

F5: ANECHOIC CONGENITAL DEAFNESS
  Prediction: congenital deaf subjects
    show no progression in anechoic
    chamber.
  Falsification: congenital deaf
    subjects show same progression
    as hearing subjects.
  Data: existing literature (semi-
    confirmed; formal test would be
    a controlled study with congenital
    deaf participants).

F6: WITHIN-FACILITY ELF GRADIENT
  Prediction: within a single facility,
    animals housed in higher-ELF sub-
    areas should show lower thigmotaxis
    than animals housed in lower-ELF
    sub-areas, when tested in the same
    arena.
  Falsification: no within-facility
    correlation.
  Data: requires EM field mapping of
    a single IMPC facility and
    housing-location metadata.

F7: SPECTRAL GEOMETRY FALSIFICATION
  (inherits from SGF v1.1):
  Prediction: cetacean coda clusters
    at eigenfunction positions of
    spermaceti organ.
  Falsification: no clustering.
  Data: CETI 2025 (available).

F8: TINNITUS AS FALSE ATTRACTOR
  Prediction: tinnitus pitch should
    cluster at eigenfunction positions
    of the cochlear resonating system.
  Falsification: tinnitus pitch
    distribution is uniform or random.
  Data: existing audiology literature.
    (This is a desk analysis that can
    be run with published tinnitus
    frequency distribution data.)

## THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT
## SENTENCE IN THIS DOCUMENT

```
The quietest room in the world is not
a curiosity about human perception.

It is the demonstration that when you
remove a sensory reference signal from
a navigator that was built to expect it,
the navigator does not stop navigating —
it amplifies its remaining signals,
confabulates structure, and eventually
generates internally what it can no
longer find externally.

The Faraday cage is the same room.
The sea turtle following an AM
transmitter is the same room.
Solitary confinement is the same room.

The navigator must navigate.
That imperative is not a feature.
It is the definition.
The ghost does not stop being the
navigation of the gaps just because
the structure that provided the gaps
has been removed.

It finds new gaps. It makes them if
it must.
