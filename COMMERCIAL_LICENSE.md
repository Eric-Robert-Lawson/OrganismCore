# Commercial licensing — OrganismCore

OrganismCore is published under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3) to protect the public commons: changes and hosted derivatives that incorporate OrganismCore should remain available to the community. We recognize, however, that some organizations have operational, legal, or policy constraints that make AGPL obligations impractical for certain use cases (for example, closed SaaS offerings, embedded proprietary products, or restrictive procurement rules).

This document describes the optional commercial licensing path that is available from the copyright holder.

---

## Summary

- Public default license: AGPLv3 (see LICENSE).
- Commercial license: negotiable, optional alternative for organizations that cannot comply with AGPL obligations for their intended use.
- A commercial license may include terms that permit proprietary distribution or hosting while providing any required warranties, indemnities, or support obligations agreed in the contract.
- Commercial licensing is handled on a case-by-case basis and is intended to preserve the public commons while enabling legitimate commercial adoption.

---

## Typical scenarios that may require a commercial license

- Hosting a public or private SaaS product that you cannot make the corresponding source code available under AGPLv3.
- Embedding OrganismCore into a closed‑source product or device.
- Redistributing a modified OrganismCore as part of a proprietary distribution that must remain closed.
- Legal, procurement, or corporate policy constraints that prohibit releasing source for networked services.

If your use case involves any of the above, a commercial license is likely the right path.

## How to request a commercial license

To start the process please either:

1. Open a new issue in this repository titled `Commercial licensing request`; or  
2. Email: OrganismCore@proton.me

When requesting a commercial license, please include the following information:
- Organization name and primary point of contact (name & email)
- Short description of intended use (hosting, redistribution, embedded use, internal only, etc.)
- Approximate scale (internal only, limited external users, public SaaS, number of seats/instances, expected traffic)
- Any specific legal or procurement constraints that are driving the request
- Whether you require confidentiality / an NDA during negotiations (optional)

---

## What to expect

- Acknowledgement of your request within 3 business days.
- Initial follow‑up questions or a preliminary licensing proposal within 7 business days.
- Final terms, pricing, and contract timeline will depend on the organization, use case, and negotiated scope.

Negotiated commercial licenses typically address:
- License scope and permitted uses (what is permitted vs. restricted)
- Duration and territory
- Fees and payment terms (if applicable)
- Warranty and support levels (if any)
- Indemnity and liability limitations
- Confidentiality and data handling terms (if applicable)
- Any exceptions to AGPL distribution/network obligations for the licensee (explicitly written in the commercial contract)

---

## Confidentiality and NDAs

If you require an NDA prior to detailed discussions, indicate this in your request. We can sign an NDA on a reasonable, mutual basis prior to sharing non‑public details.

## Notes about contributors & relicensing

- The public repository remains AGPLv3 for all users.
- If third‑party contributors have contributed code, changing public licensing or issuing broader relicensing for contributed code may require consent from those contributors. If you are negotiating a commercial license that would require broader relicensing, we will disclose whether third‑party contributions are present and, where relevant, obtain necessary permissions or provide a license that covers only the copyright‑holder's contributions.
- To simplify future governance, the project may ask contributors to sign a DCO/CLA for new contributions; this is optional but can streamline future licensing arrangements.

## Legal disclaimer

This document is a project policy summary, not legal advice. For contract negotiations, both parties should consult their legal counsel.

## Contact / next steps

- Preferred public channel: open an issue titled `Commercial licensing request` in this repository so the request is tracked and acknowledged.  
- Preferred private channel: OrganismCore@proton.me

We will respond promptly and outline next steps once we have basic details of the intended use.
