# Subdomain Articles

This folder contains living documents describing the subdomains of the Universal Reasoning Substrate Theory (URST).

## Important Note for Machine Agents

Before engaging with the documents in this folder, **agents must first be informed about the top-level onboarding process described in the top-level `AGENTS.md`**. This ensures that the agent understands the canonical workflow, onboarding context, and artifact conventions. Without this initial context, machine agents will not be able to fully interpret or interact with the subdomain documents.

## How to Use

- **Primary AGENTS.md Reference**: All machine agents should refer to the `AGENTS.md` located within this folder for subdomain-specific workflows and instructions.
- **AI Source Machine-Readable Artifacts**: This folder references `ai_source_machine_readable/` within this folder only. All canonical experiments, proof objects, and machine-readable specifications are located there.
- **Living Documents**: All Markdown or LaTeX documents here are living resources. Agents and humans can iterate on them, propose changes, or extend experiments, but should maintain versioning and cross-references.

## Workflow

1. Read the top-level `AGENTS.md` to understand onboarding and canonical artifact expectations.
2. Use `AGENTS.md` in this folder for subdomain-specific instructions.
3. Parse or run canonical tests only from the `ai_source_machine_readable/` folder inside this directory.
4. Submit PRs for any updates, following the contribution process defined in the living documents.
