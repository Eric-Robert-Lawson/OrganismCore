# OrganismCore
OrganismCore is a modular, auditable framework for advancing the study and implementation of intelligence as a shared infrastructure. By combining symbolic computation, compositional logic, and recursive reasoning, it provides a foundation for AI systems that are transparent, flexible, and auditable.

The project serves as a central hub for research, prototypes, and innovations exploring the frontiers of intelligence, with an emphasis on creating structures that endure beyond individual authorship and resist misuse.
