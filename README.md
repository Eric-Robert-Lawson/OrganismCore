# OrganismCore

🎬 **Start here:** [Automated Semantic Onboarding for AI Agents](https://youtu.be/pEGlSHxKASw)


A unified symbolic and computational framework for **objectified reasoning** — treating reasoning processes as composable, auditable, and operational structures. OrganismCore builds the foundations for a **universal reasoning substrate**, integrating symbolic computation, compositional logic, and recursive reasoning into a transparent, interpretable system.

This repository serves as the hub for research, prototypes, and documents advancing **Universal Reasoning Substrate Theory (URST)** — with the goal of making general reasoning and intelligence a shared public commons.

See the [Articles folder](/Articles/) for the conceptual documents that anchor the project.

## Using AGENTS.md for Machine-Assisted Onboarding

> **Recommended starting point for anyone new to OrganismCore.**

### Workflow with GitHub Copilot

1. Open the repository in an IDE or Codespace with Copilot enabled.  
2. Read `AGENTS.md` and 'Subdomain_AGENTS.md' to understand how agents should traverse LaTeX, Python prototypes, and conceptual documents.  
3. Explore how the AGENTS.md and Subdomain_AGENTS.md files reference project files and concepts; follow the structure shown in the tutorial to understand the automated onboarding process.


### Automated Onboarding Tutorial

[▶ Automated Semantic Onboarding for AI Agents](https://youtu.be/pEGlSHxKASw)

> For now we only have [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) in top layer and the [Subdomain_AGENTS.md](Subdomain_Articles/Subdomain_AGENTS.md) in the lower layer.

### Benefits

- **Collaborators and reviewers** can interrogate and onboard to the repo interactively.  
- Provides structured context to LLMs, improving reproducibility.  
- Enables agents to reason across the full research program.

## Reproducible Reasoning Objects

OrganismCore enables creation of **fully auditable reasoning objects**. For example, tic-tac-toe reasoning objects have been automatically onboarded to multiple AI models:

- 🔹 **Grok Code Fast 1 Model**: [View Reasoning Object](https://github.com/copilot/share/82541130-42a0-8cd0-b100-5e07e01360ae)
- 🔹 **Chat GPT-5 mini**: [View Reasoning Object](https://github.com/copilot/share/8a3c51a0-43a4-8cd0-8102-dc0ec4d949bc)
- 🔹 **Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 3.5)**: [View Reasoning Object](https://github.com/copilot/share/ca5d01b2-0b84-8876-9901-5c0ec41148ad)

These reasoning objects are **model-agnostic, fully reproducible, and auditable** by any researcher or developer.
